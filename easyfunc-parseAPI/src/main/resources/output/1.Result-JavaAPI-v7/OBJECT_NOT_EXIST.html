		</name>
		<description>
			Exception raised whenever an invocation on a deleted object was performed. It is an authoritative "hard" fault report. Anyone receiving it is allowed (even expected) to delete all copies of this object reference and to perform other appropriate "final recovery" style procedures. Bridges forward this exception to clients, also destroying any records they may hold (for example, proxy objects used in reference translation). The clients could in turn purge any of their own data structures. It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status. It may also contain a string describing the exception. See the section Minor Code Meanings to see the minor codes for this exception.
