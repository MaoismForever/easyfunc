			public final class DataBufferShort  extends DataBuffer
		</name>
		<description>
			This class extends DataBuffer and stores data internally as shorts. Note that some implementations may function more efficiently if they can maintain control over how the data for an image is stored. For example, optimizations such as caching an image in video memory require that the implementation track all modifications to that data. Other implementations may operate better if they can store the data in locations other than a Java array. To maintain optimum compatibility with various optimizations it is best to avoid constructors and methods which expose the underlying storage as a Java array as noted below in the documentation for those methods.

				<name>
					public DataBufferShort(int size)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a short-based DataBuffer with a single bank and the specified size.

			<method>
				<name>
					public DataBufferShort(int size,                 int numBanks)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a short-based DataBuffer with the specified number of banks all of which are the specified size.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public DataBufferShort(short[] dataArray,                 int size)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a short-based DataBuffer with a single bank using the specified array. Only the first size elements should be used by accessors of this DataBuffer. dataArray must be large enough to hold size elements. Note that DataBuffer objects created by this constructor may be incompatible with performance optimizations used by some implementations (such as caching an associated image in video memory).

					public DataBufferShort(short[] dataArray,                 int size,                 int offset)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a short-based DataBuffer with a single bank using the specified array, size, and offset. dataArray must have at least offset + size elements. Only elements offset through offset + size - 1 should be used by accessors of this DataBuffer. Note that DataBuffer objects created by this constructor may be incompatible with performance optimizations used by some implementations (such as caching an associated image in video memory).

					public DataBufferShort(short[][] dataArray,                 int size)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a short-based DataBuffer with the specified arrays. The number of banks will be equal to dataArray.length. Only the first size elements of each array should be used by accessors of this DataBuffer. Note that DataBuffer objects created by this constructor may be incompatible with performance optimizations used by some implementations (such as caching an associated image in video memory).

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a short-based DataBuffer with the specified arrays, size, and offsets. The number of banks is equal to dataArray.length. Each array must be at least as large as size + the corresponding offset. There must be an entry in the offset array for each dataArray entry. For each bank, only elements offset through offset + size - 1 should be used by accessors of this DataBuffer. Note that DataBuffer objects created by this constructor may be incompatible with performance optimizations used by some implementations (such as caching an associated image in video memory).
