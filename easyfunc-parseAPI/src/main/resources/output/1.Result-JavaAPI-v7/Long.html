		</name>
		<description>
			The Long class wraps a value of the primitive type long in an object. An object of type Long contains a single field whose type is long. In addition, this class provides several methods for converting a long to a String and a String to a long, as well as other constants and methods useful when dealing with a long. Implementation note: The implementations of the "bit twiddling" methods (such as highestOneBit and numberOfTrailingZeros) are based on material from Henry S. Warren, Jr.'s Hacker's Delight, (Addison Wesley, 2002).

					public static String toString(long i,                int radix)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of the first argument in the radix specified by the second argument. If the radix is smaller than Character.MIN_RADIX or larger than Character.MAX_RADIX, then the radix 10 is used instead. If the first argument is negative, the first element of the result is the ASCII minus sign '-' ('\u002d'). If the first argument is not negative, no sign character appears in the result. The remaining characters of the result represent the magnitude of the first argument. If the magnitude is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0' ('\u0030'); otherwise, the first character of the representation of the magnitude will not be the zero character. The following ASCII characters are used as digits: 0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz These are '\u0030' through '\u0039' and '\u0061' through '\u007a'. If radix is N, then the first N of these characters are used as radix-N digits in the order shown. Thus, the digits for hexadecimal (radix 16) are 0123456789abcdef. If uppercase letters are desired, the String.toUpperCase() method may be called on the result: Long.toString(n, 16).toUpperCase()

				<name>
					public static String toHexString(long i)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of the long argument as an unsigned integer in base 16. The unsigned long value is the argument plus 264 if the argument is negative; otherwise, it is equal to the argument. This value is converted to a string of ASCII digits in hexadecimal (base 16) with no extra leading 0s. If the unsigned magnitude is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0' ('\u0030'); otherwise, the first character of the representation of the unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character. The following characters are used as hexadecimal digits: 0123456789abcdef These are the characters '\u0030' through '\u0039' and '\u0061' through '\u0066'. If uppercase letters are desired, the String.toUpperCase() method may be called on the result: Long.toHexString(n).toUpperCase()

				<description>
					Returns a string representation of the long argument as an unsigned integer in base 8. The unsigned long value is the argument plus 264 if the argument is negative; otherwise, it is equal to the argument. This value is converted to a string of ASCII digits in octal (base 8) with no extra leading 0s. If the unsigned magnitude is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0' ('\u0030'); otherwise, the first character of the representation of the unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character. The following characters are used as octal digits: 01234567 These are the characters '\u0030' through '\u0037'.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static String toBinaryString(long i)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of the long argument as an unsigned integer in base 2. The unsigned long value is the argument plus 264 if the argument is negative; otherwise, it is equal to the argument. This value is converted to a string of ASCII digits in binary (base 2) with no extra leading 0s. If the unsigned magnitude is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0' ('\u0030'); otherwise, the first character of the representation of the unsigned magnitude will not be the zero character. The characters '0' ('\u0030') and '1' ('\u0031') are used as binary digits.

					public static String toString(long i)
				</name>

					public static long parseLong(String s,               int radix)                        throws NumberFormatException
				</name>
				<description>
					Parses the string argument as a signed long in the radix specified by the second argument. The characters in the string must all be digits of the specified radix (as determined by whether Character.digit(char, int) returns a nonnegative value), except that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign '-' ('\u002D') to indicate a negative value or an ASCII plus sign '+' ('\u002B') to indicate a positive value. The resulting long value is returned. Note that neither the character L ('\u004C') nor l ('\u006C') is permitted to appear at the end of the string as a type indicator, as would be permitted in Java programming language source code - except that either L or l may appear as a digit for a radix greater than 22. An exception of type NumberFormatException is thrown if any of the following situations occurs: The first argument is null or is a string of length zero. The radix is either smaller than Character.MIN_RADIX or larger than Character.MAX_RADIX. Any character of the string is not a digit of the specified radix, except that the first character may be a minus sign '-' ('\u002d') or plus sign '+' ('\u002B') provided that the string is longer than length 1. The value represented by the string is not a value of type long. Examples:    parseLong("0", 10) returns 0L   parseLong("473", 10) returns 473L   parseLong("+42", 10) returns 42L   parseLong("-0", 10) returns 0L   parseLong("-FF", 16) returns -255L   parseLong("1100110", 2) returns 102L   parseLong("99", 8) throws a NumberFormatException   parseLong("Hazelnut", 10) throws a NumberFormatException   parseLong("Hazelnut", 36) returns 1356099454469L

					public static long parseLong(String s)                        throws NumberFormatException
				</name>
				<description>
					Parses the string argument as a signed decimal long. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits, except that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign '-' (\u002D') to indicate a negative value or an ASCII plus sign '+' ('\u002B') to indicate a positive value. The resulting long value is returned, exactly as if the argument and the radix 10 were given as arguments to the parseLong(java.lang.String, int) method. Note that neither the character L ('\u004C') nor l ('\u006C') is permitted to appear at the end of the string as a type indicator, as would be permitted in Java programming language source code.

					public static Long valueOf(String s,             int radix)                      throws NumberFormatException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Long object holding the value extracted from the specified String when parsed with the radix given by the second argument. The first argument is interpreted as representing a signed long in the radix specified by the second argument, exactly as if the arguments were given to the parseLong(java.lang.String, int) method. The result is a Long object that represents the long value specified by the string. In other words, this method returns a Long object equal to the value of: new Long(Long.parseLong(s, radix))

					public static Long valueOf(String s)                      throws NumberFormatException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Long object holding the value of the specified String. The argument is interpreted as representing a signed decimal long, exactly as if the argument were given to the parseLong(java.lang.String) method. The result is a Long object that represents the integer value specified by the string. In other words, this method returns a Long object equal to the value of: new Long(Long.parseLong(s))
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static Long valueOf(long l)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Long instance representing the specified long value. If a new Long instance is not required, this method should generally be used in preference to the constructor Long(long), as this method is likely to yield significantly better space and time performance by caching frequently requested values. Note that unlike the corresponding method in the Integer class, this method is not required to cache values within a particular range.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static Long decode(String nm)                     throws NumberFormatException
				</name>
				<description>
					Decodes a String into a Long. Accepts decimal, hexadecimal, and octal numbers given by the following grammar: DecodableString: Signopt DecimalNumeral Signopt 0x HexDigits Signopt 0X HexDigits Signopt # HexDigits Signopt 0 OctalDigits Sign: - + DecimalNumeral, HexDigits, and OctalDigits are as defined in section 3.10.1 of The Java Language Specification, except that underscores are not accepted between digits. The sequence of characters following an optional sign and/or radix specifier ("0x", "0X", "#", or leading zero) is parsed as by the Long.parseLong method with the indicated radix (10, 16, or 8). This sequence of characters must represent a positive value or a NumberFormatException will be thrown. The result is negated if first character of the specified String is the minus sign. No whitespace characters are permitted in the String.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static Long getLong(String nm)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines the long value of the system property with the specified name. The first argument is treated as the name of a system property. System properties are accessible through the System.getProperty(java.lang.String) method. The string value of this property is then interpreted as a long value and a Long object representing this value is returned. Details of possible numeric formats can be found with the definition of getProperty. If there is no property with the specified name, if the specified name is empty or null, or if the property does not have the correct numeric format, then null is returned. In other words, this method returns a Long object equal to the value of: getLong(nm, null)

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static Long getLong(String nm,             long val)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines the long value of the system property with the specified name. The first argument is treated as the name of a system property. System properties are accessible through the System.getProperty(java.lang.String) method. The string value of this property is then interpreted as a long value and a Long object representing this value is returned. Details of possible numeric formats can be found with the definition of getProperty. The second argument is the default value. A Long object that represents the value of the second argument is returned if there is no property of the specified name, if the property does not have the correct numeric format, or if the specified name is empty or null. In other words, this method returns a Long object equal to the value of: getLong(nm, new Long(val)) but in practice it may be implemented in a manner such as:    Long result = getLong(nm, null);   return (result == null) ? new Long(val) : result;   to avoid the unnecessary allocation of a Long object when the default value is not needed.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static Long getLong(String nm,             Long val)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the long value of the system property with the specified name. The first argument is treated as the name of a system property. System properties are accessible through the System.getProperty(java.lang.String) method. The string value of this property is then interpreted as a long value, as per the Long.decode method, and a Long object representing this value is returned. If the property value begins with the two ASCII characters 0x or the ASCII character #, not followed by a minus sign, then the rest of it is parsed as a hexadecimal integer exactly as for the method valueOf(java.lang.String, int) with radix 16. If the property value begins with the ASCII character 0 followed by another character, it is parsed as an octal integer exactly as by the method valueOf(java.lang.String, int) with radix 8. Otherwise the property value is parsed as a decimal integer exactly as by the method valueOf(java.lang.String, int) with radix 10. Note that, in every case, neither L ('\u004C') nor l ('\u006C') is permitted to appear at the end of the property value as a type indicator, as would be permitted in Java programming language source code. The second argument is the default value. The default value is returned if there is no property of the specified name, if the property does not have the correct numeric format, or if the specified name is empty or null.

				<name>
					public static long highestOneBit(long i)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a long value with at most a single one-bit, in the position of the highest-order ("leftmost") one-bit in the specified long value. Returns zero if the specified value has no one-bits in its two's complement binary representation, that is, if it is equal to zero.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static long lowestOneBit(long i)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a long value with at most a single one-bit, in the position of the lowest-order ("rightmost") one-bit in the specified long value. Returns zero if the specified value has no one-bits in its two's complement binary representation, that is, if it is equal to zero.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static int numberOfLeadingZeros(long i)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of zero bits preceding the highest-order ("leftmost") one-bit in the two's complement binary representation of the specified long value. Returns 64 if the specified value has no one-bits in its two's complement representation, in other words if it is equal to zero. Note that this method is closely related to the logarithm base 2. For all positive long values x: floor(log2(x)) = 63 - numberOfLeadingZeros(x) ceil(log2(x)) = 64 - numberOfLeadingZeros(x - 1)
				</description>

					public static int numberOfTrailingZeros(long i)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of zero bits following the lowest-order ("rightmost") one-bit in the two's complement binary representation of the specified long value. Returns 64 if the specified value has no one-bits in its two's complement representation, in other words if it is equal to zero.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static long rotateLeft(long i,                int distance)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value obtained by rotating the two's complement binary representation of the specified long value left by the specified number of bits. (Bits shifted out of the left hand, or high-order, side reenter on the right, or low-order.) Note that left rotation with a negative distance is equivalent to right rotation: rotateLeft(val, -distance) == rotateRight(val, distance). Note also that rotation by any multiple of 64 is a no-op, so all but the last six bits of the rotation distance can be ignored, even if the distance is negative: rotateLeft(val, distance) == rotateLeft(val, distance & 0x3F).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static long rotateRight(long i,                 int distance)

				<description>
					Returns the value obtained by rotating the two's complement binary representation of the specified long value right by the specified number of bits. (Bits shifted out of the right hand, or low-order, side reenter on the left, or high-order.) Note that right rotation with a negative distance is equivalent to left rotation: rotateRight(val, -distance) == rotateLeft(val, distance). Note also that rotation by any multiple of 64 is a no-op, so all but the last six bits of the rotation distance can be ignored, even if the distance is negative: rotateRight(val, distance) == rotateRight(val, distance & 0x3F).
