		<description>
			Deprecated.  no replacement. Skeletons are no longer required for remote method calls in the Java 2 platform v1.2 and greater. This exception is thrown when a call is received that does not match the available skeleton. It indicates either that the remote method names or signatures in this interface have changed or that the stub class used to make the call and the skeleton receiving the call were not generated by the same version of the stub compiler (rmic).
