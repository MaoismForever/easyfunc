		<description>
			A thread-safe, mutable sequence of characters. A string buffer is like a String, but can be modified. At any point in time it contains some particular sequence of characters, but the length and content of the sequence can be changed through certain method calls. String buffers are safe for use by multiple threads. The methods are synchronized where necessary so that all the operations on any particular instance behave as if they occur in some serial order that is consistent with the order of the method calls made by each of the individual threads involved. The principal operations on a StringBuffer are the append and insert methods, which are overloaded so as to accept data of any type. Each effectively converts a given datum to a string and then appends or inserts the characters of that string to the string buffer. The append method always adds these characters at the end of the buffer; the insert method adds the characters at a specified point. For example, if z refers to a string buffer object whose current contents are "start", then the method call z.append("le") would cause the string buffer to contain "startle", whereas z.insert(4, "le") would alter the string buffer to contain "starlet". In general, if sb refers to an instance of a StringBuffer, then sb.append(x) has the same effect as sb.insert(sb.length(), x). Whenever an operation occurs involving a source sequence (such as appending or inserting from a source sequence) this class synchronizes only on the string buffer performing the operation, not on the source. Every string buffer has a capacity. As long as the length of the character sequence contained in the string buffer does not exceed the capacity, it is not necessary to allocate a new internal buffer array. If the internal buffer overflows, it is automatically made larger. As of release JDK 5, this class has been supplemented with an equivalent class designed for use by a single thread, StringBuilder. The StringBuilder class should generally be used in preference to this one, as it supports all of the same operations but it is faster, as it performs no synchronization.

			<method>
				<name>
					public StringBuffer()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a string buffer with no characters in it and an initial capacity of 16 characters.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StringBuffer(int capacity)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a string buffer with no characters in it and the specified initial capacity.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StringBuffer(String str)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a string buffer initialized to the contents of the specified string. The initial capacity of the string buffer is 16 plus the length of the string argument.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StringBuffer(CharSequence seq)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a string buffer that contains the same characters as the specified CharSequence. The initial capacity of the string buffer is 16 plus the length of the CharSequence argument. If the length of the specified CharSequence is less than or equal to zero, then an empty buffer of capacity 16 is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int length()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the length (character count).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int capacity()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the current capacity. The capacity is the amount of storage available for newly inserted characters, beyond which an allocation will occur.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity)
				</name>
				<description>
					Ensures that the capacity is at least equal to the specified minimum. If the current capacity is less than the argument, then a new internal array is allocated with greater capacity. The new capacity is the larger of: The minimumCapacity argument. Twice the old capacity, plus 2. If the minimumCapacity argument is nonpositive, this method takes no action and simply returns.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void trimToSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					Attempts to reduce storage used for the character sequence. If the buffer is larger than necessary to hold its current sequence of characters, then it may be resized to become more space efficient. Calling this method may, but is not required to, affect the value returned by a subsequent call to the capacity() method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setLength(int newLength)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the length of the character sequence. The sequence is changed to a new character sequence whose length is specified by the argument. For every nonnegative index k less than newLength, the character at index k in the new character sequence is the same as the character at index k in the old sequence if k is less than the length of the old character sequence; otherwise, it is the null character '\u0000'. In other words, if the newLength argument is less than the current length, the length is changed to the specified length. If the newLength argument is greater than or equal to the current length, sufficient null characters ('\u0000') are appended so that length becomes the newLength argument. The newLength argument must be greater than or equal to 0.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public char charAt(int index)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the char value in this sequence at the specified index. The first char value is at index 0, the next at index 1, and so on, as in array indexing. The index argument must be greater than or equal to 0, and less than the length of this sequence. If the char value specified by the index is a surrogate, the surrogate value is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int codePointAt(int index)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the character (Unicode code point) at the specified index. The index refers to char values (Unicode code units) and ranges from 0 to length() - 1. If the char value specified at the given index is in the high-surrogate range, the following index is less than the length of this sequence, and the char value at the following index is in the low-surrogate range, then the supplementary code point corresponding to this surrogate pair is returned. Otherwise, the char value at the given index is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int codePointBefore(int index)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the character (Unicode code point) before the specified index. The index refers to char values (Unicode code units) and ranges from 1 to length(). If the char value at (index - 1) is in the low-surrogate range, (index - 2) is not negative, and the char value at (index - 2) is in the high-surrogate range, then the supplementary code point value of the surrogate pair is returned. If the char value at index - 1 is an unpaired low-surrogate or a high-surrogate, the surrogate value is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of Unicode code points in the specified text range of this sequence. The text range begins at the specified beginIndex and extends to the char at index endIndex - 1. Thus the length (in chars) of the text range is endIndex-beginIndex. Unpaired surrogates within this sequence count as one code point each.

				</name>
				<description>
					Characters are copied from this sequence into the destination character array dst. The first character to be copied is at index srcBegin; the last character to be copied is at index srcEnd-1. The total number of characters to be copied is srcEnd-srcBegin. The characters are copied into the subarray of dst starting at index dstBegin and ending at index:    dstbegin + (srcEnd-srcBegin) - 1

					public StringBuffer append(String str)
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends the specified string to this character sequence. The characters of the String argument are appended, in order, increasing the length of this sequence by the length of the argument. If str is null, then the four characters "null" are appended. Let n be the length of this character sequence just prior to execution of the append method. Then the character at index k in the new character sequence is equal to the character at index k in the old character sequence, if k is less than n; otherwise, it is equal to the character at index k-n in the argument str.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StringBuffer append(StringBuffer sb)
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends the specified StringBuffer to this sequence. The characters of the StringBuffer argument are appended, in order, to the contents of this StringBuffer, increasing the length of this StringBuffer by the length of the argument. If sb is null, then the four characters "null" are appended to this StringBuffer. Let n be the length of the old character sequence, the one contained in the StringBuffer just prior to execution of the append method. Then the character at index k in the new character sequence is equal to the character at index k in the old character sequence, if k is less than n; otherwise, it is equal to the character at index k-n in the argument sb. This method synchronizes on this (the destination) object but does not synchronize on the source (sb).

					public StringBuffer append(CharSequence s)
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends the specified CharSequence to this sequence. The characters of the CharSequence argument are appended, in order, increasing the length of this sequence by the length of the argument. The result of this method is exactly the same as if it were an invocation of this.append(s, 0, s.length()); This method synchronizes on this (the destination) object but does not synchronize on the source (s). If s is null, then the four characters "null" are appended.

				</name>
				<description>
					Appends a subsequence of the specified CharSequence to this sequence. Characters of the argument s, starting at index start, are appended, in order, to the contents of this sequence up to the (exclusive) index end. The length of this sequence is increased by the value of end - start. Let n be the length of this character sequence just prior to execution of the append method. Then the character at index k in this character sequence becomes equal to the character at index k in this sequence, if k is less than n; otherwise, it is equal to the character at index k+start-n in the argument s. If s is null, then this method appends characters as if the s parameter was a sequence containing the four characters "null".

				<description>
					Returns the index within this string of the last occurrence of the specified substring. The integer returned is the largest value k such that:        k <= Math.min(fromIndex, str.length()) &&                     this.toString().startsWith(str, k)   If no such value of k exists, then -1 is returned.

					public StringBuffer reverse()
				</name>
				<description>
					Causes this character sequence to be replaced by the reverse of the sequence. If there are any surrogate pairs included in the sequence, these are treated as single characters for the reverse operation. Thus, the order of the high-low surrogates is never reversed. Let n be the character length of this character sequence (not the length in char values) just prior to execution of the reverse method. Then the character at index k in the new character sequence is equal to the character at index n-k-1 in the old character sequence. Note that the reverse operation may result in producing surrogate pairs that were unpaired low-surrogates and high-surrogates before the operation. For example, reversing "\uDC00\uD800" produces "\uD800\uDC00" which is a valid surrogate pair.

					public String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representing the data in this sequence. A new String object is allocated and initialized to contain the character sequence currently represented by this object. This String is then returned. Subsequent changes to this sequence do not affect the contents of the String.
