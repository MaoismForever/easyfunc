		<description>
			An implementation of ImageOutputStream that writes its output directly to a File or RandomAccessFile.

			<method>
				<name>
					public FileImageOutputStream(File f)                        throws FileNotFoundException,                               IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a FileImageOutputStream that will write to a given File.
				</description>

			<method>

					public FileImageOutputStream(RandomAccessFile raf)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a FileImageOutputStream that will write to a given RandomAccessFile.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int read()           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class: ImageInputStreamImpl Reads a single byte from the stream and returns it as an int between 0 and 255. If EOF is reached, -1 is returned. Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method. The subclass implementation should update the stream position before exiting. The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before the read occurs.

					public int read(byte[] b,         int off,         int len)           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class: ImageInputStreamImpl Reads up to len bytes from the stream, and stores them into b starting at index off. If no bytes can be read because the end of the stream has been reached, -1 is returned. The bit offset within the stream must be reset to zero before the read occurs. Subclasses must provide an implementation for this method. The subclass implementation should update the stream position before exiting.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void write(int b)             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ImageOutputStream Writes a single byte to the stream at the current position. The 24 high-order bits of b are ignored. If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the write. Implementers can use the flushBits method of ImageOutputStreamImpl to guarantee this.

					public void write(byte[] b,           int off,           int len)             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ImageOutputStream Writes a sequence of bytes to the stream at the current position. If len is 0, nothing is written. The byte b[off] is written first, then the byte b[off + 1], and so on. If the bit offset within the stream is non-zero, the remainder of the current byte is padded with 0s and written out first. The bit offset will be 0 after the write. Implementers can use the flushBits method of ImageOutputStreamImpl to guarantee this.

			<method>
				<name>
					public long length()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class: ImageInputStreamImpl Returns -1L to indicate that the stream has unknown length. Subclasses must override this method to provide actual length information.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void seek(long pos)            throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the current stream position and resets the bit offset to 0. It is legal to seeking past the end of the file; an EOFException will be thrown only if a read is performed. The file length will not be increased until a write is performed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void close()             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ImageInputStream Closes the stream. Attempts to access a stream that has been closed may result in IOExceptions or incorrect behavior. Calling this method may allow classes implementing this interface to release resources associated with the stream such as memory, disk space, or file descriptors.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void finalize()                   throws Throwable
				</name>
				<description>
					Finalizes this object prior to garbage collection. The close method is called to close any open input source. This method should not be called from application code.
