		<description>
			A JWindow is a container that can be displayed anywhere on the user's desktop. It does not have the title bar, window-management buttons, or other trimmings associated with a JFrame, but it is still a "first-class citizen" of the user's desktop, and can exist anywhere on it. The JWindow component contains a JRootPane as its only child. The contentPane should be the parent of any children of the JWindow. As a conveniance add and its variants, remove and setLayout have been overridden to forward to the contentPane as necessary. This means you can write:          window.add(child);   And the child will be added to the contentPane. The contentPane will always be non-null. Attempting to set it to null will cause the JWindow to throw an exception. The default contentPane will have a BorderLayout manager set on it. Refer to RootPaneContainer for details on adding, removing and setting the LayoutManager of a JWindow. Please see the JRootPane documentation for a complete description of the contentPane, glassPane, and layeredPane components. In a multi-screen environment, you can create a JWindow on a different screen device. See Window for more information. Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more information see Swing's Threading Policy. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected boolean rootPaneCheckingEnabled
				</name>
				<description>
					If true then calls to add and setLayout will be forwarded to the contentPane. This is initially false, but is set to true when the JWindow is constructed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>

					The accessible context property.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public JWindow()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a window with no specified owner. This window will not be focusable. This constructor sets the component's locale property to the value returned by JComponent.getDefaultLocale.

					public JWindow(GraphicsConfiguration gc)
				</name>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public JWindow(Frame owner)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a window with the specified owner frame. If owner is null, the shared owner will be used and this window will not be focusable. Also, this window will not be focusable unless its owner is showing on the screen. This constructor sets the component's locale property to the value returned by JComponent.getDefaultLocale.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public JWindow(Window owner)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a window with the specified owner window. This window will not be focusable unless its owner is showing on the screen. If owner is null, the shared owner will be used and this window will not be focusable. This constructor sets the component's locale property to the value returned by JComponent.getDefaultLocale.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public JWindow(Window owner,         GraphicsConfiguration gc)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a window with the specified owner window and GraphicsConfiguration of a screen device. If owner is null, the shared owner will be used and this window will not be focusable. This constructor sets the component's locale property to the value returned by JComponent.getDefaultLocale.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected void windowInit()

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected boolean isRootPaneCheckingEnabled()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether calls to add and setLayout are forwarded to the contentPane.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setTransferHandler(TransferHandler newHandler)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the transferHandler property, which is a mechanism to support transfer of data into this component. Use null if the component does not support data transfer operations. If the system property suppressSwingDropSupport is false (the default) and the current drop target on this component is either null or not a user-set drop target, this method will change the drop target as follows: If newHandler is null it will clear the drop target. If not null it will install a new DropTarget. Note: When used with JWindow, TransferHandler only provides data import capability, as the data export related methods are currently typed to JComponent. Please see How to Use Drag and Drop and Data Transfer, a section in The Java Tutorial, for more information.
