		<description>
			This Paint interface defines how color patterns can be generated for Graphics2D operations. A class implementing the Paint interface is added to the Graphics2D context in order to define the color pattern used by the draw and fill methods. Instances of classes implementing Paint must be read-only because the Graphics2D does not clone these objects when they are set as an attribute with the setPaint method or when the Graphics2D object is itself cloned.

					Creates and returns a PaintContext used to generate the color pattern. The arguments to this method convey additional information about the rendering operation that may be used or ignored on various implementations of the Paint interface. A caller must pass non-null values for all of the arguments except for the ColorModel argument which may be null to indicate that no specific ColorModel type is preferred. Implementations of the Paint interface are allowed to use or ignore any of the arguments as makes sense for their function, and are not constrained to use the specified ColorModel for the returned PaintContext, even if it is not null. Implementations are allowed to throw NullPointerException for any null argument other than the ColorModel argument, but are not required to do so.
