		<description>
			A Rectangle specifies an area in a coordinate space that is enclosed by the Rectangle object's upper-left point (x,y) in the coordinate space, its width, and its height. A Rectangle object's width and height are public fields. The constructors that create a Rectangle, and the methods that can modify one, do not prevent setting a negative value for width or height. A Rectangle whose width or height is exactly zero has location along those axes with zero dimension, but is otherwise considered empty. The isEmpty() method will return true for such a Rectangle. Methods which test if an empty Rectangle contains or intersects a point or rectangle will always return false if either dimension is zero. Methods which combine such a Rectangle with a point or rectangle will include the location of the Rectangle on that axis in the result as if the add(Point) method were being called. A Rectangle whose width or height is negative has neither location nor dimension along those axes with negative dimensions. Such a Rectangle is treated as non-existant along those axes. Such a Rectangle is also empty with respect to containment calculations and methods which test if it contains or intersects a point or rectangle will always return false. Methods which combine such a Rectangle with a point or rectangle will ignore the Rectangle entirely in generating the result. If two Rectangle objects are combined and each has a negative dimension, the result will have at least one negative dimension. Methods which affect only the location of a Rectangle will operate on its location regardless of whether or not it has a negative or zero dimension along either axis. Note that a Rectangle constructed with the default no-argument constructor will have dimensions of 0x0 and therefore be empty. That Rectangle will still have a location of (0,0) and will contribute that location to the union and add operations. Code attempting to accumulate the bounds of a set of points should therefore initially construct the Rectangle with a specifically negative width and height or it should use the first point in the set to construct the Rectangle. For example:        Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(0, 0, -1, -1);       for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {           bounds.add(points[i]);       }   or if we know that the points array contains at least one point:        Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(points[0]);       for (int i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {           bounds.add(points[i]);       }   This class uses 32-bit integers to store its location and dimensions. Frequently operations may produce a result that exceeds the range of a 32-bit integer. The methods will calculate their results in a way that avoids any 32-bit overflow for intermediate results and then choose the best representation to store the final results back into the 32-bit fields which hold the location and dimensions. The location of the result will be stored into the x and y fields by clipping the true result to the nearest 32-bit value. The values stored into the width and height dimension fields will be chosen as the 32-bit values that encompass the largest part of the true result as possible. Generally this means that the dimension will be clipped independently to the range of 32-bit integers except that if the location had to be moved to store it into its pair of 32-bit fields then the dimensions will be adjusted relative to the "best representation" of the location. If the true result had a negative dimension and was therefore non-existant along one or both axes, the stored dimensions will be negative numbers in those axes. If the true result had a location that could be represented within the range of 32-bit integers, but zero dimension along one or both axes, then the stored dimensions will be zero in those axes.

					public Rectangle2D getBounds2D()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of the Shape than the getBounds method. Note that there is no guarantee that the returned Rectangle2D is the smallest bounding box that encloses the Shape, only that the Shape lies entirely within the indicated Rectangle2D. The bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that returned by the getBounds method and never fails due to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of the Rectangle2D that uses double precision values to store the dimensions. Note that the definition of insideness can lead to situations where points on the defining outline of the shape may not be considered contained in the returned bounds object, but only in cases where those points are also not considered contained in the original shape. If a point is inside the shape according to the contains(point) method, then it must be inside the returned Rectangle2D bounds object according to the contains(point) method of the bounds. Specifically: shape.contains(p) requires bounds.contains(p) If a point is not inside the shape, then it might still be contained in the bounds object: bounds.contains(p) does not imply shape.contains(p)

				</name>
				<description>
					Computes the union of this Rectangle with the specified Rectangle. Returns a new Rectangle that represents the union of the two rectangles. If either Rectangle has any dimension less than zero the rules for non-existant rectangles apply. If only one has a dimension less than zero, then the result will be a copy of the other Rectangle. If both have dimension less than zero, then the result will have at least one dimension less than zero. If the resulting Rectangle would have a dimension too large to be expressed as an int, the result will have a dimension of Integer.MAX_VALUE along that dimension.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void add(int newx,         int newy)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a point, specified by the integer arguments newx,newy to the bounds of this Rectangle. If this Rectangle has any dimension less than zero, the rules for non-existant rectangles apply. In that case, the new bounds of this Rectangle will have a location equal to the specified coordinates and width and height equal to zero. After adding a point, a call to contains with the added point as an argument does not necessarily return true. The contains method does not return true for points on the right or bottom edges of a Rectangle. Therefore, if the added point falls on the right or bottom edge of the enlarged Rectangle, contains returns false for that point. If the specified point must be contained within the new Rectangle, a 1x1 rectangle should be added instead:        r.add(newx, newy, 1, 1);
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public void add(Point pt)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified Point to the bounds of this Rectangle. If this Rectangle has any dimension less than zero, the rules for non-existant rectangles apply. In that case, the new bounds of this Rectangle will have a location equal to the coordinates of the specified Point and width and height equal to zero. After adding a Point, a call to contains with the added Point as an argument does not necessarily return true. The contains method does not return true for points on the right or bottom edges of a Rectangle. Therefore if the added Point falls on the right or bottom edge of the enlarged Rectangle, contains returns false for that Point. If the specified point must be contained within the new Rectangle, a 1x1 rectangle should be added instead:        r.add(pt.x, pt.y, 1, 1);
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void add(Rectangle r)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a Rectangle to this Rectangle. The resulting Rectangle is the union of the two rectangles. If either Rectangle has any dimension less than 0, the result will have the dimensions of the other Rectangle. If both Rectangles have at least one dimension less than 0, the result will have at least one dimension less than 0. If either Rectangle has one or both dimensions equal to 0, the result along those axes with 0 dimensions will be equivalent to the results obtained by adding the corresponding origin coordinate to the result rectangle along that axis, similar to the operation of the add(Point) method, but contribute no further dimension beyond that. If the resulting Rectangle would have a dimension too large to be expressed as an int, the result will have a dimension of Integer.MAX_VALUE along that dimension.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void grow(int h,          int v)
				</name>
				<description>
					Resizes the Rectangle both horizontally and vertically. This method modifies the Rectangle so that it is h units larger on both the left and right side, and v units larger at both the top and bottom. The new Rectangle has (x - h, y - v) as its upper-left corner, width of (width + 2h), and a height of (height + 2v). If negative values are supplied for h and v, the size of the Rectangle decreases accordingly. The grow method will check for integer overflow and underflow, but does not check whether the resulting values of width and height grow from negative to non-negative or shrink from non-negative to negative.
