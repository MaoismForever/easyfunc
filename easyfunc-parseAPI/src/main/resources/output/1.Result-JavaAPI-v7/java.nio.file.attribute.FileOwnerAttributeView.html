		<description>
			A file attribute view that supports reading or updating the owner of a file. This file attribute view is intended for file system implementations that support a file attribute that represents an identity that is the owner of the file. Often the owner of a file is the identity of the entity that created the file. The getOwner or setOwner methods may be used to read or update the owner of the file. The getAttribute and setAttribute methods may also be used to read or update the owner. In that case, the owner attribute is identified by the name "owner", and the value of the attribute is a UserPrincipal.
