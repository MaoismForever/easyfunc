		</name>
		<description>
			An action to set paragraph alignment. This sets the StyleConstants.Alignment attribute for the currently selected range of the target JEditorPane. This is done by calling StyledDocument.setParagraphAttributes on the styled document associated with the target JEditorPane. If the target text component is specified as the source of the ActionEvent and there is a command string, the command string will be interpreted as an integer that should be one of the legal values for the StyleConstants.Alignment attribute. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
