				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport instance, which describes the operation of a class of open MBeans, with the specified name, description, signature, returnOpenType and impact. The signature array parameter is internally copied, so that subsequent changes to the array referenced by signature have no effect on this instance.

					Constructs an OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport instance, which describes the operation of a class of open MBeans, with the specified name, description, signature, returnOpenType, impact, and descriptor.

					public OpenType<?> getReturnOpenType()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the open type of the values returned by the operation described by this OpenMBeanOperationInfo instance.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean equals(Object obj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares the specified obj parameter with this OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport instance for equality. Returns true if and only if all of the following statements are true: obj is non null, obj also implements the OpenMBeanOperationInfo interface, their names are equal their signatures are equal their return open types are equal their impacts are equal This ensures that this equals method works properly for obj parameters which are different implementations of the OpenMBeanOperationInfo interface.

			<method>
				<name>
					public int hashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the hash code value for this OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport instance. The hash code of an OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport instance is the sum of the hash codes of all elements of information used in equals comparisons (ie: its name, return open type, impact and signature, where the signature hashCode is calculated by a call to java.util.Arrays.asList(this.getSignature).hashCode()). This ensures that t1.equals(t2) implies that t1.hashCode()==t2.hashCode() for any two OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport instances t1 and t2, as required by the general contract of the method Object.hashCode(). However, note that another instance of a class implementing the OpenMBeanOperationInfo interface may be equal to this OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport instance as defined by equals(java.lang.Object), but may have a different hash code if it is calculated differently. As OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport instances are immutable, the hash code for this instance is calculated once, on the first call to hashCode, and then the same value is returned for subsequent calls.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport instance. The string representation consists of the name of this class (ie javax.management.openmbean.OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport), and the name, signature, return open type and impact of the described operation and the string representation of its descriptor. As OpenMBeanOperationInfoSupport instances are immutable, the string representation for this instance is calculated once, on the first call to toString, and then the same value is returned for subsequent calls.
