		<description>
			Represents a built in, or custom, state in Nimbus. Synth provides several built in states, which are: Enabled Mouse Over Pressed Disabled Focused Selected Default However, there are many more states that could be described in a LookAndFeel, and it would be nice to style components differently based on these different states. For example, a progress bar could be "indeterminate". It would be very convenient to allow this to be defined as a "state". This class, State, is intended to be used for such situations. Simply implement the abstract #isInState method. It returns true if the given JComponent is "in this state", false otherwise. This method will be called many times in performance sensitive loops. It must execute very quickly. For example, the following might be an implementation of a custom "Indeterminate" state for JProgressBars:        public final class IndeterminateState extends State<JProgressBar> {           public IndeterminateState() {               super("Indeterminate");           }             @Override           protected boolean isInState(JProgressBar c) {               return c.isIndeterminate();           }       }

					Create a new custom State. Specify the name for the state. The name should be unique within the states set for any one particular component. The name of the state should coincide with the name used in UIDefaults. For example, the following would be correct:        defaults.put("Button.States", "Enabled, Foo, Disabled");       defaults.put("Button.Foo", new FooState("Foo"));

				<description>
					Description copied from class: Object Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the toString method returns a string that "textually represents" this object. The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read. It is recommended that all subclasses override this method. The toString method for class Object returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character `@', and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value of:    getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())

				<description>
					Gets whether the specified JComponent is in the custom state represented by this class. This is an extremely performance sensitive loop. Please take proper precautions to ensure that it executes quickly. Nimbus uses this method to help determine what state a JComponent is in. For example, a custom State could exist for JProgressBar such that it would return true when the progress bar is indeterminate. Such an implementation of this method would simply be:  return c.isIndeterminate();
