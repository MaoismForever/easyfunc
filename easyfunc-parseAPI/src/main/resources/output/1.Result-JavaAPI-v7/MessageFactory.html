		</name>
		<description>
			A factory for creating SOAPMessage objects. A SAAJ client can create a MessageFactory object using the method newInstance, as shown in the following lines of code.          MessageFactory mf = MessageFactory.newInstance();         MessageFactory mf12 = MessageFactory.newInstance(SOAPConstants.SOAP_1_2_PROTOCOL);   All MessageFactory objects, regardless of how they are created, will produce SOAPMessage objects that have the following elements by default: A SOAPPart object A SOAPEnvelope object A SOAPBody object A SOAPHeader object In some cases, specialized MessageFactory objects may be obtained that produce messages prepopulated with additional entries in the SOAPHeader object and the SOAPBody object. The content of a new SOAPMessage object depends on which of the two MessageFactory methods is used to create it. createMessage() This is the method clients would normally use to create a request message. createMessage(MimeHeaders, java.io.InputStream) -- message has content from the InputStream object and headers from the MimeHeaders object This method can be used internally by a service implementation to create a message that is a response to a request.

					Creates a new MessageFactory object that is an instance of the default implementation (SOAP 1.1), This method uses the following ordered lookup procedure to determine the MessageFactory implementation class to load: Use the javax.xml.soap.MessageFactory system property. Use the properties file "lib/jaxm.properties" in the JRE directory. This configuration file is in standard java.util.Properties format and contains the fully qualified name of the implementation class with the key being the system property defined above. Use the Services API (as detailed in the JAR specification), if available, to determine the classname. The Services API will look for a classname in the file META-INF/services/javax.xml.soap.MessageFactory in jars available to the runtime. Use the SAAJMetaFactory instance to locate the MessageFactory implementation class.

				<description>
					Creates a new MessageFactory object that is an instance of the specified implementation. May be a dynamic message factory, a SOAP 1.1 message factory, or a SOAP 1.2 message factory. A dynamic message factory creates messages based on the MIME headers specified as arguments to the createMessage method. This method uses the SAAJMetaFactory to locate the implementation class and create the MessageFactory instance.

				<description>
					Creates a new SOAPMessage object with the default SOAPPart, SOAPEnvelope, SOAPBody, and SOAPHeader objects. Profile-specific message factories can choose to prepopulate the SOAPMessage object with profile-specific headers. Content can be added to this message's SOAPPart object, and the message can be sent "as is" when a message containing only a SOAP part is sufficient. Otherwise, the SOAPMessage object needs to create one or more AttachmentPart objects and add them to itself. Any content that is not in XML format must be in an AttachmentPart object.
