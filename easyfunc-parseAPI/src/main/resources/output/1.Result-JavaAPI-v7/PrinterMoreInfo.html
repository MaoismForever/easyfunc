		<description>
			Class PrinterMoreInfo is a printing attribute class, a URI, that is used to obtain more information about this specific printer. For example, this could be an HTTP type URI referencing an HTML page accessible to a web browser. The information obtained from this URI is intended for end user consumption. Features outside the scope of the Print Service API can be accessed from this URI. The information is intended to be specific to this printer instance and site specific services (e.g. job pricing, services offered, end user assistance). In contrast, the PrinterMoreInfoManufacturer attribute is used to find out more information about this general kind of printer rather than this specific printer. IPP Compatibility: The string form returned by toString() gives the IPP uri value. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
