			public class PixelGrabber  extends Object  implements ImageConsumer
		</name>
		<description>
			The PixelGrabber class implements an ImageConsumer which can be attached to an Image or ImageProducer object to retrieve a subset of the pixels in that image. Here is an example:      public void handlesinglepixel(int x, int y, int pixel) {        int alpha = (pixel >> 24) & 0xff;        int red   = (pixel >> 16) & 0xff;        int green = (pixel >>  8) & 0xff;        int blue  = (pixel      ) & 0xff;        // Deal with the pixel as necessary...   }     public void handlepixels(Image img, int x, int y, int w, int h) {        int[] pixels = new int[w * h];        PixelGrabber pg = new PixelGrabber(img, x, y, w, h, pixels, 0, w);        try {            pg.grabPixels();        } catch (InterruptedException e) {            System.err.println("interrupted waiting for pixels!");            return;        }        if ((pg.getStatus() & ImageObserver.ABORT) != 0) {            System.err.println("image fetch aborted or errored");            return;        }        for (int j = 0; j < h; j++) {            for (int i = 0; i < w; i++) {                handlesinglepixel(x+i, y+j, pixels[j * w + i]);            }        }   }

				<description>
					Create a PixelGrabber object to grab the (x, y, w, h) rectangular section of pixels from the specified image into the given array. The pixels are stored into the array in the default RGB ColorModel. The RGB data for pixel (i, j) where (i, j) is inside the rectangle (x, y, w, h) is stored in the array at pix[(j - y) * scansize + (i - x) + off].

				<description>
					Create a PixelGrabber object to grab the (x, y, w, h) rectangular section of pixels from the image produced by the specified ImageProducer into the given array. The pixels are stored into the array in the default RGB ColorModel. The RGB data for pixel (i, j) where (i, j) is inside the rectangle (x, y, w, h) is stored in the array at pix[(j - y) * scansize + (i - x) + off].

				</name>
				<description>
					Create a PixelGrabber object to grab the (x, y, w, h) rectangular section of pixels from the specified image. The pixels are accumulated in the original ColorModel if the same ColorModel is used for every call to setPixels, otherwise the pixels are accumulated in the default RGB ColorModel. If the forceRGB parameter is true, then the pixels will be accumulated in the default RGB ColorModel anyway. A buffer is allocated by the PixelGrabber to hold the pixels in either case. If (w < 0) or (h < 0), then they will default to the remaining width and height of the source data when that information is delivered.

					public boolean grabPixels()                     throws InterruptedException

					Request the Image or ImageProducer to start delivering pixels and wait for all of the pixels in the rectangle of interest to be delivered.

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean grabPixels(long ms)                     throws InterruptedException
				</name>
				<description>
					Request the Image or ImageProducer to start delivering pixels and wait for all of the pixels in the rectangle of interest to be delivered or until the specified timeout has elapsed. This method behaves in the following ways, depending on the value of ms: If ms == 0, waits until all pixels are delivered If ms > 0, waits until all pixels are delivered as timeout expires. If ms < 0, returns true if all pixels are grabbed, false otherwise and does not wait.

			<method>

					public int getStatus()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the status of the pixels. The ImageObserver flags representing the available pixel information are returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getWidth()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the width of the pixel buffer (after adjusting for image width). If no width was specified for the rectangle of pixels to grab then then this information will only be available after the image has delivered the dimensions.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getHeight()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the height of the pixel buffer (after adjusting for image height). If no width was specified for the rectangle of pixels to grab then then this information will only be available after the image has delivered the dimensions.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object getPixels()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the pixel buffer. If the PixelGrabber was not constructed with an explicit pixel buffer to hold the pixels then this method will return null until the size and format of the image data is known. Since the PixelGrabber may fall back on accumulating the data in the default RGB ColorModel at any time if the source image uses more than one ColorModel to deliver the data, the array object returned by this method may change over time until the image grab is complete.

			<method>
				<name>
					public ColorModel getColorModel()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the ColorModel for the pixels stored in the array. If the PixelGrabber was constructed with an explicit pixel buffer then this method will always return the default RGB ColorModel, otherwise it may return null until the ColorModel used by the ImageProducer is known. Since the PixelGrabber may fall back on accumulating the data in the default RGB ColorModel at any time if the source image uses more than one ColorModel to deliver the data, the ColorModel object returned by this method may change over time until the image grab is complete and may not reflect any of the ColorModel objects that was used by the ImageProducer to deliver the pixels.

					The setDimensions method is part of the ImageConsumer API which this class must implement to retrieve the pixels.

					public int status()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the status of the pixels. The ImageObserver flags representing the available pixel information are returned. This method and getStatus have the same implementation, but getStatus is the preferred method because it conforms to the convention of naming information-retrieval methods with the form "getXXX".
