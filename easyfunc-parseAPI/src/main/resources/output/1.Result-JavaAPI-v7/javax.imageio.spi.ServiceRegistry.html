		<description>
			A registry for service provider instances. A service is a well-known set of interfaces and (usually abstract) classes. A service provider is a specific implementation of a service. The classes in a provider typically implement the interface or subclass the class defined by the service itself. Service providers are stored in one or more categories, each of which is defined by a class of interface (described by a Class object) that all of its members must implement. The set of categories may be changed dynamically. Only a single instance of a given leaf class (that is, the actual class returned by getClass(), as opposed to any inherited classes or interfaces) may be registered. That is, suppose that the com.mycompany.mypkg.GreenServiceProvider class implements the com.mycompany.mypkg.MyService interface. If a GreenServiceProvider instance is registered, it will be stored in the category defined by the MyService class. If a new instance of GreenServiceProvider is registered, it will replace the previous instance. In practice, service provider objects are usually singletons so this behavior is appropriate. To declare a service provider, a services subdirectory is placed within the META-INF directory that is present in every JAR file. This directory contains a file for each service provider interface that has one or more implementation classes present in the JAR file. For example, if the JAR file contained a class named com.mycompany.mypkg.MyServiceImpl which implements the javax.someapi.SomeService interface, the JAR file would contain a file named:    META-INF/services/javax.someapi.SomeService containing the line:    com.mycompany.mypkg.MyService   The service provider classes should be to be lightweight and quick to load. Implementations of these interfaces should avoid complex dependencies on other classes and on native code. The usual pattern for more complex services is to register a lightweight proxy for the heavyweight service. An application may customize the contents of a registry as it sees fit, so long as it has the appropriate runtime permission. For more details on declaring service providers, and the JAR format in general, see the JAR File Specification.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ServiceRegistry(Iterator<Class<?>> categories)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a ServiceRegistry instance with a set of categories taken from the categories argument.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static <T> Iterator<T> lookupProviders(Class<T> providerClass,                                ClassLoader loader)
				</name>
				<description>
					Searches for implementations of a particular service class using the given class loader. This method transforms the name of the given service class into a provider-configuration filename as described in the class comment and then uses the getResources method of the given class loader to find all available files with that name. These files are then read and parsed to produce a list of provider-class names. The iterator that is returned uses the given class loader to look up and then instantiate each element of the list. Because it is possible for extensions to be installed into a running Java virtual machine, this method may return different results each time it is invoked.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static <T> Iterator<T> lookupProviders(Class<T> providerClass)
				</name>
				<description>
					Locates and incrementally instantiates the available providers of a given service using the context class loader. This convenience method is equivalent to:      ClassLoader cl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();     return Service.providers(service, cl);
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Iterator<Class<?>> getCategories()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an Iterator of Class objects indicating the current set of categories. The iterator will be empty if no categories exist.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public <T> boolean registerServiceProvider(T provider,                                    Class<T> category)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a service provider object to the registry. The provider is associated with the given category. If provider implements the RegisterableService interface, its onRegistration method will be called. Its onDeregistration method will be called each time it is deregistered from a category, for example if a category is removed or the registry is garbage collected.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void registerServiceProvider(Object provider)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a service provider object to the registry. The provider is associated within each category present in the registry whose Class it implements. If provider implements the RegisterableService interface, its onRegistration method will be called once for each category it is registered under. Its onDeregistration method will be called each time it is deregistered from a category or when the registry is finalized.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void registerServiceProviders(Iterator<?> providers)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a set of service provider objects, taken from an Iterator to the registry. Each provider is associated within each category present in the registry whose Class it implements. For each entry of providers that implements the RegisterableService interface, its onRegistration method will be called once for each category it is registered under. Its onDeregistration method will be called each time it is deregistered from a category or when the registry is finalized.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public <T> boolean deregisterServiceProvider(T provider,                                      Class<T> category)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes a service provider object from the given category. If the provider was not previously registered, nothing happens and false is returned. Otherwise, true is returned. If an object of the same class as provider but not equal (using ==) to provider is registered, it will not be deregistered. If provider implements the RegisterableService interface, its onDeregistration method will be called.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void deregisterServiceProvider(Object provider)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes a service provider object from all categories that contain it.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean contains(Object provider)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if provider is currently registered.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public <T> Iterator<T> getServiceProviders(Class<T> category,                                    boolean useOrdering)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an Iterator containing all registered service providers in the given category. If useOrdering is false, the iterator will return all of the server provider objects in an arbitrary order. Otherwise, the ordering will respect any pairwise orderings that have been set. If the graph of pairwise orderings contains cycles, any providers that belong to a cycle will not be returned.

			<method>
				<name>
					public <T> Iterator<T> getServiceProviders(Class<T> category,                                    ServiceRegistry.Filter filter,                                    boolean useOrdering)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an Iterator containing service provider objects within a given category that satisfy a criterion imposed by the supplied ServiceRegistry.Filter object's filter method. The useOrdering argument controls the ordering of the results using the same rules as getServiceProviders(Class, boolean).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public <T> T getServiceProviderByClass(Class<T> providerClass)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the currently registered service provider object that is of the given class type. At most one object of a given class is allowed to be registered at any given time. If no registered object has the desired class type, null is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public <T> boolean setOrdering(Class<T> category,                        T firstProvider,                        T secondProvider)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets a pairwise ordering between two service provider objects within a given category. If one or both objects are not currently registered within the given category, or if the desired ordering is already set, nothing happens and false is returned. If the providers previously were ordered in the reverse direction, that ordering is removed. The ordering will be used by the getServiceProviders methods when their useOrdering argument is true.

					public <T> boolean unsetOrdering(Class<T> category,                          T firstProvider,                          T secondProvider)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets a pairwise ordering between two service provider objects within a given category. If one or both objects are not currently registered within the given category, or if no ordering is currently set between them, nothing happens and false is returned. The ordering will be used by the getServiceProviders methods when their useOrdering argument is true.
