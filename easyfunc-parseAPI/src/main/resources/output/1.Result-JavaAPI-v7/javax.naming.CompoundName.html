			public class CompoundName  extends Object  implements Name
		</name>
		<description>
			This class represents a compound name -- a name from a hierarchical name space. Each component in a compound name is an atomic name. The components of a compound name are numbered. The indexes of a compound name with N components range from 0 up to, but not including, N. This range may be written as [0,N). The most significant component is at index 0. An empty compound name has no components. Compound Name Syntax The syntax of a compound name is specified using a set of properties: jndi.syntax.direction Direction for parsing ("right_to_left", "left_to_right", "flat"). If unspecified, defaults to "flat", which means the namespace is flat with no hierarchical structure. jndi.syntax.separator Separator between atomic name components. Required unless direction is "flat". jndi.syntax.ignorecase If present, "true" means ignore the case when comparing name components. If its value is not "true", or if the property is not present, case is considered when comparing name components. jndi.syntax.escape If present, specifies the escape string for overriding separator, escapes and quotes. jndi.syntax.beginquote If present, specifies the string delimiting start of a quoted string. jndi.syntax.endquote String delimiting end of quoted string. If present, specifies the string delimiting the end of a quoted string. If not present, use syntax.beginquote as end quote. jndi.syntax.beginquote2 Alternative set of begin/end quotes. jndi.syntax.endquote2 Alternative set of begin/end quotes. jndi.syntax.trimblanks If present, "true" means trim any leading and trailing whitespaces in a name component for comparison purposes. If its value is not "true", or if the property is not present, blanks are significant. jndi.syntax.separator.ava If present, specifies the string that separates attribute-value-assertions when specifying multiple attribute/value pairs. (e.g. "," in age=65,gender=male). jndi.syntax.separator.typeval If present, specifies the string that separators attribute from value (e.g. "=" in "age=65") These properties are interpreted according to the following rules: In a string without quotes or escapes, any instance of the separator delimits two atomic names. Each atomic name is referred to as a component. A separator, quote or escape is escaped if preceded immediately (on the left) by the escape. If there are two sets of quotes, a specific begin-quote must be matched by its corresponding end-quote. A non-escaped begin-quote which precedes a component must be matched by a non-escaped end-quote at the end of the component. A component thus quoted is referred to as a quoted component. It is parsed by removing the being- and end- quotes, and by treating the intervening characters as ordinary characters unless one of the rules involving quoted components listed below applies. Quotes embedded in non-quoted components are treated as ordinary strings and need not be matched. A separator that is escaped or appears between non-escaped quotes is treated as an ordinary string and not a separator. An escape string within a quoted component acts as an escape only when followed by the corresponding end-quote string. This can be used to embed an escaped quote within a quoted component. An escaped escape string is not treated as an escape string. An escape string that does not precede a meta string (quotes or separator) and is not at the end of a component is treated as an ordinary string. A leading separator (the compound name string begins with a separator) denotes a leading empty atomic component (consisting of an empty string). A trailing separator (the compound name string ends with a separator) denotes a trailing empty atomic component. Adjacent separators denote an empty atomic component. The string form of the compound name follows the syntax described above. When the components of the compound name are turned into their string representation, the reserved syntax rules described above are applied (e.g. embedded separators are escaped or quoted) so that when the same string is parsed, it will yield the same components of the original compound name. Multithreaded Access A CompoundName instance is not synchronized against concurrent multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a CompoundName should lock the object.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected transient javax.naming.NameImpl impl
				</name>
				<description>
					Implementation of this compound name. This field is initialized by the constructors and cannot be null. It should be treated as a read-only variable by subclasses.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected transient Properties mySyntax
				</name>
				<description>
					Syntax properties for this compound name. This field is initialized by the constructors and cannot be null. It should be treated as a read-only variable by subclasses. Any necessary changes to mySyntax should be made within constructors and not after the compound name has been instantiated.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected CompoundName(Enumeration<String> comps,              Properties syntax)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new compound name instance using the components specified in comps and syntax. This protected method is intended to be to be used by subclasses of CompoundName when they override methods such as clone(), getPrefix(), getSuffix().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public CompoundName(String n,              Properties syntax)               throws InvalidNameException
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new compound name instance by parsing the string n using the syntax specified by the syntax properties supplied.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Generates the string representation of this compound name, using the syntax rules of the compound name. The syntax rules are described in the class description. An empty component is represented by an empty string. The string representation thus generated can be passed to the CompoundName constructor with the same syntax properties to create a new equivalent compound name.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean equals(Object obj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether obj is syntactically equal to this compound name. If obj is null or not a CompoundName, false is returned. Two compound names are equal if each component in one is "equal" to the corresponding component in the other. Equality is also defined in terms of the syntax of this compound name. The default implementation of CompoundName uses the syntax properties jndi.syntax.ignorecase and jndi.syntax.trimblanks when comparing two components for equality. If case is ignored, two strings with the same sequence of characters but with different cases are considered equal. If blanks are being trimmed, leading and trailing blanks are ignored for the purpose of the comparison. Both compound names must have the same number of components. Implementation note: Currently the syntax properties of the two compound names are not compared for equality. They might be in the future.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int hashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Computes the hash code of this compound name. The hash code is the sum of the hash codes of the "canonicalized" forms of individual components of this compound name. Each component is "canonicalized" according to the compound name's syntax before its hash code is computed. For a case-insensitive name, for example, the uppercased form of a name has the same hash code as its lowercased equivalent.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object clone()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a copy of this compound name. Changes to the components of this compound name won't affect the new copy and vice versa. The clone and this compound name share the same syntax.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int compareTo(Object obj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares this CompoundName with the specified Object for order. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this Name is less than, equal to, or greater than the given Object. If obj is null or not an instance of CompoundName, ClassCastException is thrown. See equals() for what it means for two compound names to be equal. If two compound names are equal, 0 is returned. Ordering of compound names depend on the syntax of the compound name. By default, they follow lexicographical rules for string comparison with the extension that this applies to all the components in the compound name and that comparison of individual components is affected by the jndi.syntax.ignorecase and jndi.syntax.trimblanks properties, identical to how they affect equals(). If this compound name is "lexicographically" lesser than obj, a negative number is returned. If this compound name is "lexicographically" greater than obj, a positive number is returned. Implementation note: Currently the syntax properties of the two compound names are not compared when checking order. They might be in the future.
