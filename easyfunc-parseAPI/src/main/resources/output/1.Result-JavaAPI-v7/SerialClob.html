			public class SerialClob  extends Object  implements Clob, Serializable, Cloneable
		</name>
		<description>
			A serialized mapping in the Java programming language of an SQL CLOB value. The SerialClob class provides a constructor for creating an instance from a Clob object. Note that the Clob object should have brought the SQL CLOB value's data over to the client before a SerialClob object is constructed from it. The data of an SQL CLOB value can be materialized on the client as a stream of Unicode characters. SerialClob methods make it possible to get a substring from a SerialClob object or to locate the start of a pattern of characters.

				<name>
					public SerialClob(char[] ch)             throws SerialException,                    SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a SerialClob object that is a serialized version of the given char array. The new SerialClob object is initialized with the data from the char array, thus allowing disconnected RowSet objects to establish a serialized Clob object without touching the data source.

				<name>
					public SerialClob(Clob clob)             throws SerialException,                    SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a SerialClob object that is a serialized version of the given Clob object. The new SerialClob object is initialized with the data from the Clob object; therefore, the Clob object should have previously brought the SQL CLOB value's data over to the client from the database. Otherwise, the new SerialClob object object will contain no data. Note: The Clob object supplied to this constructor must return non-null for both the Clob.getCharacterStream() and Clob.getAsciiStream methods. This SerialClob constructor cannot serialize a Clob object in this instance and will throw an SQLException object.

			<method>
				<name>
					public long length()              throws SerialException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the number of characters in this SerialClob object's array of characters.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Reader getCharacterStream()                            throws SerialException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns this SerialClob object's data as a stream of Unicode characters. Unlike the related method, getAsciiStream, a stream is produced regardless of whether the SerialClob object was created with a Clob object or a char array.
				</description>
				
			</method>

				<name>
					public InputStream getAsciiStream()                             throws SerialException,                                    SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the CLOB value designated by this SerialClob object as an ascii stream. This method forwards the getAsciiStream call to the underlying Clob object in the event that this SerialClob object is instantiated with a Clob object. If this SerialClob object is instantiated with a char array, a SerialException object is thrown.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a copy of the substring contained in this SerialClob object, starting at the given position and continuing for the specified number or characters.

			<method>
				<name>
					public long position(String searchStr,              long start)                throws SerialException,                       SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the position in this SerialClob object where the given String object begins, starting the search at the specified position. This method returns -1 if the pattern is not found.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the position in this SerialClob object where the given Clob signature begins, starting the search at the specified position. This method returns -1 if the pattern is not found.

				<description>
					Writes the given Java String to the CLOB value that this SerialClob object represents, at the position pos.

					public int setString(long pos,              String str,              int offset,              int length)                throws SerialException
				</name>
				<description>
					Writes len characters of str, starting at character offset, to the CLOB value that this Clob represents.

					public OutputStream setAsciiStream(long pos)                              throws SerialException,                                     SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves a stream to be used to write Ascii characters to the CLOB value that this SerialClob object represents, starting at position pos. This method forwards the setAsciiStream() call to the underlying Clob object in the event that this SerialClob object is instantiated with a Clob object. If this SerialClob object is instantiated with a char array, a SerialException object is thrown.

				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves a stream to be used to write a stream of Unicode characters to the CLOB value that this SerialClob object represents, at position pos. This method forwards the setCharacterStream() call to the underlying Clob object in the event that this SerialClob object is instantiated with a Clob object. If this SerialClob object is instantiated with a char array, a SerialException is thrown.

					public void truncate(long length)                throws SerialException
				</name>
				<description>
					Truncates the CLOB value that this SerialClob object represents so that it has a length of len characters. Truncating a SerialClob object to length 0 has the effect of clearing its contents.

				<description>
					Description copied from interface: Clob Returns a Reader object that contains a partial Clob value, starting with the character specified by pos, which is length characters in length.

					public void free()            throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: Clob This method frees the Clob object and releases the resources the resources that it holds. The object is invalid once the free method is called. After free has been called, any attempt to invoke a method other than free will result in a SQLException being thrown. If free is called multiple times, the subsequent calls to free are treated as a no-op.
