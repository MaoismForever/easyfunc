		<description>
			A point-to-point connection that a client can use for sending messages directly to a remote party (represented by a URL, for instance). The SOAPConnection class is optional. Some implementations may not implement this interface in which case the call to SOAPConnectionFactory.newInstance() (see below) will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. A client can obtain a SOAPConnection object using a SOAPConnectionFactory object as in the following example:         SOAPConnectionFactory factory = SOAPConnectionFactory.newInstance();        SOAPConnection con = factory.createConnection();   A SOAPConnection object can be used to send messages directly to a URL following the request/response paradigm. That is, messages are sent using the method call, which sends the message and then waits until it gets a reply.
