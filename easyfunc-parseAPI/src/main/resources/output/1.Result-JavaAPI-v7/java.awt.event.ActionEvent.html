			public class ActionEvent  extends AWTEvent
		</name>
		<description>
			A semantic event which indicates that a component-defined action occurred. This high-level event is generated by a component (such as a Button) when the component-specific action occurs (such as being pressed). The event is passed to every ActionListener object that registered to receive such events using the component's addActionListener method. Note: To invoke an ActionEvent on a Button using the keyboard, use the Space bar. The object that implements the ActionListener interface gets this ActionEvent when the event occurs. The listener is therefore spared the details of processing individual mouse movements and mouse clicks, and can instead process a "meaningful" (semantic) event like "button pressed". An unspecified behavior will be caused if the id parameter of any particular ActionEvent instance is not in the range from ACTION_FIRST to ACTION_LAST.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int ACTION_FIRST
				</name>
				<description>
					The first number in the range of ids used for action events.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int ACTION_LAST
				</name>
				<description>
					The last number in the range of ids used for action events.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int ACTION_PERFORMED
				</name>
				<description>
					This event id indicates that a meaningful action occured.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public ActionEvent(Object source,             int id,             String command)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an ActionEvent object. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null. A null command string is legal, but not recommended.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public ActionEvent(Object source,             int id,             String command,             int modifiers)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an ActionEvent object with modifier keys. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null. A null command string is legal, but not recommended.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ActionEvent(Object source,             int id,             String command,             long when,             int modifiers)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an ActionEvent object with the specified modifier keys and timestamp. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null. A null command string is legal, but not recommended.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getActionCommand()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the command string associated with this action. This string allows a "modal" component to specify one of several commands, depending on its state. For example, a single button might toggle between "show details" and "hide details". The source object and the event would be the same in each case, but the command string would identify the intended action. Note that if a null command string was passed to the constructor for this ActionEvent, this this method returns null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public long getWhen()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the timestamp of when this event occurred. Because an ActionEvent is a high-level, semantic event, the timestamp is typically the same as an underlying InputEvent.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getModifiers()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the modifier keys held down during this action event.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String paramString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a parameter string identifying this action event. This method is useful for event-logging and for debugging.
