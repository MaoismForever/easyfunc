			This class is for various network permissions. An SSLPermission contains a name (also referred to as a "target name") but no actions list; you either have the named permission or you don't. The target name is the name of the network permission (see below). The naming convention follows the hierarchical property naming convention. Also, an asterisk may appear at the end of the name, following a ".", or by itself, to signify a wildcard match. For example: "foo.*" or "*" is valid, "*foo" or "a*b" is not valid. The following table lists all the possible SSLPermission target names, and for each provides a description of what the permission allows and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission. Permission Target Name What the Permission Allows Risks of Allowing this Permission setHostnameVerifier The ability to set a callback which can decide whether to allow a mismatch between the host being connected to by an HttpsURLConnection and the common name field in server certificate. Malicious code can set a verifier that monitors host names visited by HttpsURLConnection requests or that allows server certificates with invalid common names. getSSLSessionContext The ability to get the SSLSessionContext of an SSLSession. Malicious code may monitor sessions which have been established with SSL peers or might invalidate sessions to slow down performance. setDefaultSSLContext The ability to set the default SSL context Malicious code can set a context that monitors the opening of connections or the plaintext data that is transmitted.
