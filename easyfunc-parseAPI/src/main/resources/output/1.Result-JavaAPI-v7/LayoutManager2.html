			public interface LayoutManager2  extends LayoutManager
		</name>
		<description>
			Defines an interface for classes that know how to layout Containers based on a layout constraints object. This interface extends the LayoutManager interface to deal with layouts explicitly in terms of constraint objects that specify how and where components should be added to the layout. This minimal extension to LayoutManager is intended for tool providers who wish to the creation of constraint-based layouts. It does not yet provide full, general support for custom constraint-based layout managers.

				<name>
					void마ddLayoutComponent(Component맊omp,                        Object맊onstraints)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified component to the layout, using the specified constraint object.

			<method>
				<name>
					Dimension맔aximumLayoutSize(Container맚arget)
				</name>
				<description>
					Calculates the maximum size dimensions for the specified container, given the components it contains.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					float많etLayoutAlignmentX(Container맚arget)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the alignment along the x axis. This specifies how the component would like to be aligned relative to other components. The value should be a number between 0 and 1 where 0 represents alignment along the origin, 1 is aligned the furthest away from the origin, 0.5 is centered, etc.

			<method>
				<name>
					float많etLayoutAlignmentY(Container맚arget)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the alignment along the y axis. This specifies how the component would like to be aligned relative to other components. The value should be a number between 0 and 1 where 0 represents alignment along the origin, 1 is aligned the furthest away from the origin, 0.5 is centered, etc.

					void말nvalidateLayout(Container맚arget)
				</name>
				<description>
					Invalidates the layout, indicating that if the layout manager has cached information it should be discarded.
