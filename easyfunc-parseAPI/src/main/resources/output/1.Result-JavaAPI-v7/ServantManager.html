		<description>
			A servant manager supplies a POA with the ability to activate objects on demand when the POA receives a request targeted at an inactive object. A servant manager is registered with a POA as a callback object, to be invoked by the POA when necessary. ServantManagers can either be ServantActivators or ServantLocators. A ServantManager object must be local to the process containing the POA objects it is registered with.
