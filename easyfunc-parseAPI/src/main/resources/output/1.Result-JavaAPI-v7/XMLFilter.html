		<description>
			Interface for an XML filter. This module, both source code and documentation, is in the Public Domain, and comes with NO WARRANTY. See http://www.saxproject.org for further information. An XML filter is like an XML reader, except that it obtains its events from another XML reader rather than a primary source like an XML document or database. Filters can modify a stream of events as they pass on to the final application. The XMLFilterImpl helper class provides a convenient base for creating SAX2 filters, by passing on all EntityResolver, DTDHandler, ContentHandler and ErrorHandler events automatically.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					void setParent(XMLReader parent)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the parent reader. This method allows the application to link the filter to a parent reader (which may be another filter). The argument may not be null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					XMLReader getParent()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the parent reader. This method allows the application to query the parent reader (which may be another filter). It is generally a bad idea to perform any operations on the parent reader directly: they should all pass through this filter.
