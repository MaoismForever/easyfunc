		<description>
			Interface for associating a SAX event with a document location. This module, both source code and documentation, is in the Public Domain, and comes with NO WARRANTY. See http://www.saxproject.org for further information. If a SAX parser provides location information to the SAX application, it does so by implementing this interface and then passing an instance to the application using the content handler's setDocumentLocator method. The application can use the object to obtain the location of any other SAX event in the XML source document. Note that the results returned by the object will be valid only during the scope of each callback method: the application will receive unpredictable results if it attempts to use the locator at any other time, or after parsing completes. SAX parsers are not required to supply a locator, but they are very strongly encouraged to do so. If the parser supplies a locator, it must do so before reporting any other document events. If no locator has been set by the time the application receives the startDocument event, the application should assume that a locator is not available.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					String많etPublicId()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the public identifier for the current document event. The return value is the public identifier of the document entity or of the external parsed entity in which the markup triggering the event appears.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					String많etSystemId()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the system identifier for the current document event. The return value is the system identifier of the document entity or of the external parsed entity in which the markup triggering the event appears. If the system identifier is a URL, the parser must resolve it fully before passing it to the application. For example, a file name must always be provided as a file:... URL, and other kinds of relative URI are also resolved against their bases.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int많etLineNumber()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the line number where the current document event ends. Lines are delimited by line ends, which are defined in the XML specification. Warning: The return value from the method is intended only as an approximation for the sake of diagnostics; it is not intended to provide sufficient information to edit the character content of the original XML document. In some cases, these "line" numbers match what would be displayed as columns, and in others they may not match the source text due to internal entity expansion. The return value is an approximation of the line number in the document entity or external parsed entity where the markup triggering the event appears. If possible, the SAX driver should provide the line position of the first character after the text associated with the document event. The first line is line 1.

			<method>
				<name>
					int많etColumnNumber()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the column number where the current document event ends. This is one-based number of Java char values since the last line end. Warning: The return value from the method is intended only as an approximation for the sake of diagnostics; it is not intended to provide sufficient information to edit the character content of the original XML document. For example, when lines contain combining character sequences, wide characters, surrogate pairs, or bi-directional text, the value may not correspond to the column in a text editor's display. The return value is an approximation of the column number in the document entity or external parsed entity where the markup triggering the event appears. If possible, the SAX driver should provide the line position of the first character after the text associated with the document event. The first column in each line is column 1.
