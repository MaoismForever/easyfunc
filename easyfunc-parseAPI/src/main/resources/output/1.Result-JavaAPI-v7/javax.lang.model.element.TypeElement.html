		<name>
			public interface TypeElement  extends Element, Parameterizable, QualifiedNameable
		</name>
		<description>
			Represents a class or interface program element. Provides access to information about the type and its members. Note that an enum type is a kind of class and an annotation type is a kind of interface. While a TypeElement represents a class or interface element, a DeclaredType represents a class or interface type, the latter being a use (or invocation) of the former. The distinction is most apparent with generic types, for which a single element can define a whole family of types. For example, the element java.util.Set corresponds to the parameterized types java.util.Set<String> and java.util.Set<Number> (and many others), and to the raw type java.util.Set. Each method of this interface that returns a list of elements will return them in the order that is natural for the underlying source of program information. For example, if the underlying source of information is Java source code, then the elements will be returned in source code order.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					List<? extends Element>많etEnclosedElements()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the elements that are, loosely speaking, directly enclosed by this element. A class or interface is considered to enclose the fields, methods, constructors, and member types that it directly declares. This includes any (implicit) default constructor and the implicit values and valueOf methods of an enum type. A package encloses the top-level classes and interfaces within it, but is not considered to enclose subpackages. Other kinds of elements are not currently considered to enclose any elements; however, that may change as this API or the programming language evolves. Note that elements of certain kinds can be isolated using methods in ElementFilter. Note that as a particular instance of the general accuracy requirements and the ordering behavior required of this interface, the list of enclosed elements will be returned in the natural order for the originating source of information about the type. For example, if the information about the type is originating from a source file, the elements will be returned in source code order. (However, in that case the the ordering of synthesized elements, such as a default constructor, is not specified.)

			<method>
				<name>
					NestingKind많etNestingKind()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the nesting kind of this type element.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Name많etQualifiedName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the fully qualified name of this type element. More precisely, it returns the canonical name. For local and anonymous classes, which do not have canonical names, an empty name is returned. The name of a generic type does not include any reference to its formal type parameters. For example, the fully qualified name of the interface java.util.Set<E> is "java.util.Set". Nested types use "." as a separator, as in "java.util.Map.Entry".

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Name많etSimpleName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the simple name of this type element. For an anonymous class, an empty name is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					TypeMirror많etSuperclass()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the direct superclass of this type element. If this type element represents an interface or the class java.lang.Object, then a NoType with kind NONE is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					List<? extends TypeMirror>많etInterfaces()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the interface types directly implemented by this class or extended by this interface.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					List<? extends TypeParameterElement>많etTypeParameters()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the formal type parameters of this type element in declaration order.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Element많etEnclosingElement()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the package of a top-level type and returns the immediately lexically enclosing element for a nested type.
