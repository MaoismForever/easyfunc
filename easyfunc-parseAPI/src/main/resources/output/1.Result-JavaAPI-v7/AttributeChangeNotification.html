			public class AttributeChangeNotification  extends Notification
		</name>
		<description>
			Provides definitions of the attribute change notifications sent by MBeans. It's up to the MBean owning the attribute of interest to create and send attribute change notifications when the attribute change occurs. So the NotificationBroadcaster interface has to be implemented by any MBean for which an attribute change is of interest. Example: If an MBean called myMbean needs to notify registered listeners when its attribute: String myString is modified, myMbean creates and emits the following notification: new AttributeChangeNotification(myMbean, sequenceNumber, timeStamp, msg, "myString", "String", oldValue, newValue);
