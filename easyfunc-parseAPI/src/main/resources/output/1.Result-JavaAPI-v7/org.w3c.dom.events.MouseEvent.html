			public interface MouseEvent  extends UIEvent
		</name>
		<description>
			The MouseEvent interface provides specific contextual information associated with Mouse events. The detail attribute inherited from UIEvent indicates the number of times a mouse button has been pressed and released over the same screen location during a user action. The attribute value is 1 when the user begins this action and increments by 1 for each full sequence of pressing and releasing. If the user moves the mouse between the mousedown and mouseup the value will be set to 0, indicating that no click is occurring. In the case of nested elements mouse events are always targeted at the most deeply nested element. Ancestors of the targeted element may use bubbling to obtain notification of mouse events which occur within its descendent elements. See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Events Specification.

			<method>
				<name>
					boolean getCtrlKey()
				</name>
				<description>
					Used to indicate whether the 'ctrl' key was depressed during the firing of the event.

					boolean getShiftKey()
				</name>
				<description>
					Used to indicate whether the 'shift' key was depressed during the firing of the event.

			<method>
				<name>
					boolean getAltKey()
				</name>
				<description>
					Used to indicate whether the 'alt' key was depressed during the firing of the event. On some platforms this key may map to an alternative key name.

			<method>
				<name>
					boolean getMetaKey()
				</name>
				<description>
					Used to indicate whether the 'meta' key was depressed during the firing of the event. On some platforms this key may map to an alternative key name.

			<method>
				<name>
					short getButton()
				</name>
				<description>
					During mouse events caused by the depression or release of a mouse button, button is used to indicate which mouse button changed state. The values for button range from zero to indicate the left button of the mouse, one to indicate the middle button if present, and two to indicate the right button. For mice configured for left handed use in which the button actions are reversed the values are instead read from right to left.

			<method>
				<name>
					EventTarget getRelatedTarget()
				</name>
				<description>
					Used to identify a secondary EventTarget related to a UI event. Currently this attribute is used with the mouseover event to indicate the EventTarget which the pointing device exited and with the mouseout event to indicate the EventTarget which the pointing device entered.

				<description>
					The initMouseEvent method is used to initialize the value of a MouseEvent created through the DocumentEvent interface. This method may only be called before the MouseEvent has been dispatched via the dispatchEvent method, though it may be called multiple times during that phase if necessary. If called multiple times, the final invocation takes precedence.
