		</name>
		<description>
			An action to set foreground color. This sets the StyleConstants.Foreground attribute for the currently selected range of the target JEditorPane. This is done by calling StyledDocument.setCharacterAttributes on the styled document associated with the target JEditorPane. If the target text component is specified as the source of the ActionEvent and there is a command string, the command string will be interpreted as the foreground color. It will be interpreted by called Color.decode, and should therefore be legal input for that method. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
