			The interface that all standard implementations of CachedRowSet must implement. The reference implementation of the CachedRowSet interface provided by Oracle Corporation is a standard implementation. Developers may use this implementation just as it is, they may extend it, or they may choose to write their own implementations of this interface. A CachedRowSet object is a container for rows of data that caches its rows in memory, which makes it possible to operate without always being connected to its data source. Further, it is a JavaBeansTM component and is scrollable, updatable, and serializable. A CachedRowSet object typically contains rows from a result set, but it can also contain rows from any file with a tabular format, such as a spread sheet. The reference implementation supports getting data only from a ResultSet object, but developers can extend the SyncProvider implementations to provide access to other tabular data sources. An application can modify the data in a CachedRowSet object, and those modifications can then be propagated back to the source of the data. A CachedRowSet object is a disconnected rowset, which means that it makes use of a connection to its data source only briefly. It connects to its data source while it is reading data to populate itself with rows and again while it is propagating changes back to its underlying data source. The rest of the time, a CachedRowSet object is disconnected, including while its data is being modified. Being disconnected makes a RowSet object much leaner and therefore much easier to pass to another component. For example, a disconnected RowSet object can be serialized and passed over the wire to a thin client such as a personal digital assistant (PDA). 1.0 Creating a CachedRowSet Object The following line of code uses the default constructor for CachedRowSet supplied in the reference implementation (RI) to create a default CachedRowSet object.        CachedRowSetImpl crs = new CachedRowSetImpl();   This new CachedRowSet object will have its properties set to the default properties of a BaseRowSet object, and, in addition, it will have an RIOptimisticProvider object as its synchronization provider. RIOptimisticProvider, one of two SyncProvider implementations included in the RI, is the default provider that the SyncFactory singleton will supply when no synchronization provider is specified. A SyncProvider object provides a CachedRowSet object with a reader (a RowSetReader object) for reading data from a data source to populate itself with data. A reader can be implemented to read data from a ResultSet object or from a file with a tabular format. A SyncProvider object also provides a writer (a RowSetWriter object) for synchronizing any modifications to the CachedRowSet object's data made while it was disconnected with the data in the underlying data source. A writer can be implemented to exercise various degrees of care in checking for conflicts and in avoiding them. (A conflict occurs when a value in the data source has been changed after the rowset populated itself with that value.) The RIOptimisticProvider implementation assumes there will be few or no conflicts and therefore sets no locks. It updates the data source with values from the CachedRowSet object only if there are no conflicts. Other writers can be implemented so that they always write modified data to the data source, which can be accomplished either by not checking for conflicts or, on the other end of the spectrum, by setting locks sufficient to prevent data in the data source from being changed. Still other writer implementations can be somewhere in between. A CachedRowSet object may use any SyncProvider implementation that has been registered with the SyncFactory singleton. An application can find out which SyncProvider implementations have been registered by calling the following line of code.         java.util.Enumeration providers = SyncFactory.getRegisteredProviders();   There are two ways for a CachedRowSet object to specify which SyncProvider object it will use. Supplying the name of the implementation to the constructor The following line of code creates the CachedRowSet object crs2 that is initialized with default values except that its SyncProvider object is the one specified.             CachedRowSetImpl crs2 = new CachedRowSetImpl(                                   "com.fred.providers.HighAvailabilityProvider");
