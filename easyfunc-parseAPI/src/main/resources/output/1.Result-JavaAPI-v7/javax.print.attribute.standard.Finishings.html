		<description>
			Class Finishings is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that identifies whether the printer applies a finishing operation of some kind of binding to each copy of each printed document in the job. For multidoc print jobs (jobs with multiple documents), the MultipleDocumentHandling attribute determines what constitutes a "copy" for purposes of finishing. Standard Finishings values are:   NONE STAPLE EDGE_STITCH   BIND SADDLE_STITCH COVER   The following Finishings values are more specific; they indicate a corner or an edge as if the document were a portrait document:   STAPLE_TOP_LEFT EDGE_STITCH_LEFT STAPLE_DUAL_LEFT     STAPLE_BOTTOM_LEFT EDGE_STITCH_TOP STAPLE_DUAL_TOP     STAPLE_TOP_RIGHT EDGE_STITCH_RIGHT STAPLE_DUAL_RIGHT     STAPLE_BOTTOM_RIGHT EDGE_STITCH_BOTTOM STAPLE_DUAL_BOTTOM   The STAPLE_XXX values are specified with respect to the document as if the document were a portrait document. If the document is actually a landscape or a reverse-landscape document, the client supplies the appropriate transformed value. For example, to position a staple in the upper left hand corner of a landscape document when held for reading, the client supplies the STAPLE_BOTTOM_LEFT value (since landscape is defined as a +90 degree rotation from portrait, i.e., anti-clockwise). On the other hand, to position a staple in the upper left hand corner of a reverse-landscape document when held for reading, the client supplies the STAPLE_TOP_RIGHT value (since reverse-landscape is defined as a -90 degree rotation from portrait, i.e., clockwise). The angle (vertical, horizontal, angled) of each staple with respect to the document depends on the implementation which may in turn depend on the value of the attribute. The effect of a Finishings attribute on a multidoc print job (a job with multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same binding specified or whether different docs have different bindings specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the MultipleDocumentHandling attribute. If all the docs have the same binding specified, then any value of MultipleDocumentHandling makes sense, and the printer's processing depends on the MultipleDocumentHandling value: SINGLE_DOCUMENT -- All the input docs will be bound together as one output document with the specified binding. SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET -- All the input docs will be bound together as one output document with the specified binding, and the first impression of each input doc will always start on a new media sheet. SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES -- Each input doc will be bound separately with the specified binding. SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES -- Each input doc will be bound separately with the specified binding. If different docs have different bindings specified, then only two values of MultipleDocumentHandling make sense, and the printer reports an error when the job is submitted if any other value is specified: SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES -- Each input doc will be bound separately with its own specified binding. SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES -- Each input doc will be bound separately with its own specified binding. IPP Compatibility: Class Finishings encapsulates some of the IPP enum values that can be included in an IPP "finishings" attribute, which is a set of enums. The category name returned by getName() is the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum value. The toString() method returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value. In IPP Finishings is a multi-value attribute, this API currently allows only one binding to be specified.
