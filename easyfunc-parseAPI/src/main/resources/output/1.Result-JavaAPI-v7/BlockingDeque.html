		</name>
		<description>
			A Deque that additionally supports blocking operations that wait for the deque to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait for space to become available in the deque when storing an element. BlockingDeque methods come in four forms, with different ways of handling operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be satisfied at some point in the future: one throws an exception, the second returns a special value (either null or false, depending on the operation), the third blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed, and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving up. These methods are summarized in the following table: First Element (Head) Throws exception Special value Blocks Times out Insert addFirst(e) offerFirst(e) putFirst(e) offerFirst(e, time, unit) Remove removeFirst() pollFirst() takeFirst() pollFirst(time, unit) Examine getFirst() peekFirst() not applicable not applicable Last Element (Tail) Throws exception Special value Blocks Times out Insert addLast(e) offerLast(e) putLast(e) offerLast(e, time, unit) Remove removeLast() pollLast() takeLast() pollLast(time, unit) Examine getLast() peekLast() not applicable not applicable Like any BlockingQueue, a BlockingDeque is thread safe, does not permit null elements, and may (or may not) be capacity-constrained. A BlockingDeque implementation may be used directly as a FIFO BlockingQueue. The methods inherited from the BlockingQueue interface are precisely equivalent to BlockingDeque methods as indicated in the following table: BlockingQueue Method Equivalent BlockingDeque Method Insert add(e) addLast(e) offer(e) offerLast(e) put(e) putLast(e) offer(e, time, unit) offerLast(e, time, unit) Remove remove() removeFirst() poll() pollFirst() take() takeFirst() poll(time, unit) pollFirst(time, unit) Examine element() getFirst() peek() peekFirst() Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a BlockingDeque happen-before actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from the BlockingDeque in another thread. This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					void addFirst(E e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts the specified element at the front of this deque if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, throwing an IllegalStateException if no space is currently available. When using a capacity-restricted deque, it is generally preferable to use offerFirst.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void addLast(E e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts the specified element at the end of this deque if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, throwing an IllegalStateException if no space is currently available. When using a capacity-restricted deque, it is generally preferable to use offerLast.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean offerFirst(E e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts the specified element at the front of this deque if it is possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions, returning true upon success and false if no space is currently available. When using a capacity-restricted deque, this method is generally preferable to the addFirst method, which can fail to insert an element only by throwing an exception.
