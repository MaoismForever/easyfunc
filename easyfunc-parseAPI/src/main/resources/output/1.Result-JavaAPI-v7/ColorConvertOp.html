			public class ColorConvertOp  extends Object  implements BufferedImageOp, RasterOp
		</name>
		<description>
			This class performs a pixel-by-pixel color conversion of the data in the source image. The resulting color values are scaled to the precision of the destination image. Color conversion can be specified via an array of ColorSpace objects or an array of ICC_Profile objects. If the source is a BufferedImage with premultiplied alpha, the color components are divided by the alpha component before color conversion. If the destination is a BufferedImage with premultiplied alpha, the color components are multiplied by the alpha component after conversion. Rasters are treated as having no alpha channel, i.e. all bands are color bands. If a RenderingHints object is specified in the constructor, the color rendering hint and the dithering hint may be used to control color conversion. Note that Source and Destination may be the same object.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ColorConvertOp(RenderingHints hints)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new ColorConvertOp which will convert from a source color space to a destination color space. The RenderingHints argument may be null. This Op can be used only with BufferedImages, and will convert directly from the ColorSpace of the source image to that of the destination. The destination argument of the filter method cannot be specified as null.

				<name>
					public ColorConvertOp(ColorSpace cspace,                RenderingHints hints)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new ColorConvertOp from a ColorSpace object. The RenderingHints argument may be null. This Op can be used only with BufferedImages, and is primarily useful when the filter method is invoked with a destination argument of null. In that case, the ColorSpace defines the destination color space for the destination created by the filter method. Otherwise, the ColorSpace defines an intermediate space to which the source is converted before being converted to the destination space.

					public ColorConvertOp(ColorSpace srcCspace,                ColorSpace dstCspace,                RenderingHints hints)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new ColorConvertOp from two ColorSpace objects. The RenderingHints argument may be null. This Op is primarily useful for calling the filter method on Rasters, in which case the two ColorSpaces define the operation to be performed on the Rasters. In that case, the number of bands in the source Raster must match the number of components in srcCspace, and the number of bands in the destination Raster must match the number of components in dstCspace. For BufferedImages, the two ColorSpaces define intermediate spaces through which the source is converted before being converted to the destination space.

			<method>
				<name>
					public ColorConvertOp(ICC_Profile[] profiles,                RenderingHints hints)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new ColorConvertOp from an array of ICC_Profiles. The RenderingHints argument may be null. The sequence of profiles may include profiles that represent color spaces, profiles that represent effects, etc. If the whole sequence does not represent a well-defined color conversion, an exception is thrown. For BufferedImages, if the ColorSpace of the source BufferedImage does not match the requirements of the first profile in the array, the first conversion is to an appropriate ColorSpace. If the requirements of the last profile in the array are not met by the ColorSpace of the destination BufferedImage, the last conversion is to the destination's ColorSpace. For Rasters, the number of bands in the source Raster must match the requirements of the first profile in the array, and the number of bands in the destination Raster must match the requirements of the last profile in the array. The array must have at least two elements or calling the filter method for Rasters will throw an IllegalArgumentException.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final ICC_Profile[] getICC_Profiles()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the array of ICC_Profiles used to construct this ColorConvertOp. Returns null if the ColorConvertOp was not constructed from such an array.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final BufferedImage filter(BufferedImage src,                     BufferedImage dest)
				</name>
				<description>
					ColorConverts the source BufferedImage. If the destination image is null, a BufferedImage will be created with an appropriate ColorModel.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final WritableRaster filter(Raster src,                      WritableRaster dest)
				</name>
				<description>
					ColorConverts the image data in the source Raster. If the destination Raster is null, a new Raster will be created. The number of bands in the source and destination Rasters must meet the requirements explained above. The constructor used to create this ColorConvertOp must have provided enough information to define both source and destination color spaces. See above. Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final Rectangle2D getBounds2D(BufferedImage src)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the bounding box of the destination, given this source. Note that this will be the same as the the bounding box of the source.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final Rectangle2D getBounds2D(Raster src)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the bounding box of the destination, given this source. Note that this will be the same as the the bounding box of the source.

				<description>
					Creates a zeroed destination image with the correct size and number of bands, given this source.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the location of the destination point given a point in the source. If dstPt is non-null, it will be used to hold the return value. Note that for this class, the destination point will be the same as the source point.
