				<name>
					public static final말nt ACTION_LINK
				</name>
				<description>
					An int representing a "link" action. The link verb is found in many, if not all native DnD platforms, and the actual interpretation of LINK semantics is both platform and application dependent. Broadly speaking, the semantic is "do not copy, or move the operand, but create a reference to it". Defining the meaning of "reference" is where ambiguity is introduced. The verb is provided for completeness, but its use is not recommended for DnD operations between logically distinct applications where misinterpretation of the operations semantics could lead to confusing results for the user.
