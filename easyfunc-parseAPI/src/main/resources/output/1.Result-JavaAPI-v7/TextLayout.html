		<description>
			TextLayout is an immutable graphical representation of styled character data. It provides the following capabilities: implicit bidirectional analysis and reordering, cursor positioning and movement, including split cursors for mixed directional text, highlighting, including both logical and visual highlighting for mixed directional text, multiple baselines (roman, hanging, and centered), hit testing, justification, default font substitution, metric information such as ascent, descent, and advance, and rendering A TextLayout object can be rendered using its draw method. TextLayout can be constructed either directly or through the use of a LineBreakMeasurer. When constructed directly, the source text represents a single paragraph. LineBreakMeasurer allows styled text to be broken into lines that fit within a particular width. See the LineBreakMeasurer documentation for more information. TextLayout construction logically proceeds as follows: paragraph attributes are extracted and examined, text is analyzed for bidirectional reordering, and reordering information is computed if needed, text is segmented into style runs fonts are chosen for style runs, first by using a font if the attribute TextAttribute.FONT is present, otherwise by computing a default font using the attributes that have been defined if text is on multiple baselines, the runs or subruns are further broken into subruns sharing a common baseline, glyphvectors are generated for each run using the chosen font, final bidirectional reordering is performed on the glyphvectors All graphical information returned from a TextLayout object's methods is relative to the origin of the TextLayout, which is the intersection of the TextLayout object's baseline with its left edge. Also, coordinates passed into a TextLayout object's methods are assumed to be relative to the TextLayout object's origin. Clients usually need to translate between a TextLayout object's coordinate system and the coordinate system in another object (such as a Graphics object). TextLayout objects are constructed from styled text, but they do not retain a reference to their source text. Thus, changes in the text previously used to generate a TextLayout do not affect the TextLayout. Three methods on a TextLayout object (getNextRightHit, getNextLeftHit, and hitTestChar) return instances of TextHitInfo. The offsets contained in these TextHitInfo objects are relative to the start of the TextLayout, not to the text used to create the TextLayout. Similarly, TextLayout methods that accept TextHitInfo instances as parameters expect the TextHitInfo object's offsets to be relative to the TextLayout, not to any underlying text storage model. Examples: Constructing and drawing a TextLayout and its bounding rectangle:      Graphics2D g = ...;     Point2D loc = ...;     Font font = Font.getFont("Helvetica-bold-italic");     FontRenderContext frc = g.getFontRenderContext();     TextLayout layout = new TextLayout("This is a string", font, frc);     layout.draw(g, (float)loc.getX(), (float)loc.getY());       Rectangle2D bounds = layout.getBounds();     bounds.setRect(bounds.getX()+loc.getX(),                    bounds.getY()+loc.getY(),                    bounds.getWidth(),                    bounds.getHeight());     g.draw(bounds);   Hit-testing a TextLayout (determining which character is at a particular graphical location):      Point2D click = ...;     TextHitInfo hit = layout.hitTestChar(                           (float) (click.getX() - loc.getX()),                           (float) (click.getY() - loc.getY()));   Responding to a right-arrow key press:      int insertionIndex = ...;     TextHitInfo next = layout.getNextRightHit(insertionIndex);     if (next != null) {         // translate graphics to origin of layout on screen         g.translate(loc.getX(), loc.getY());         Shape[] carets = layout.getCaretShapes(next.getInsertionIndex());         g.draw(carets[0]);         if (carets[1] != null) {             g.draw(carets[1]);         }     }   Drawing a selection range corresponding to a substring in the source text. The selected area may not be visually contiguous:      // selStart, selLimit should be relative to the layout,     // not to the source text       int selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;     Color selectionColor = ...;     Shape selection = layout.getLogicalHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);     // selection may consist of disjoint areas     // graphics is assumed to be tranlated to origin of layout     g.setColor(selectionColor);     g.fill(selection);   Drawing a visually contiguous selection range. The selection range may correspond to more than one substring in the source text. The ranges of the corresponding source text substrings can be obtained with getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection():      TextHitInfo selStart = ..., selLimit = ...;     Shape selection = layout.getVisualHighlightShape(selStart, selLimit);     g.setColor(selectionColor);     g.fill(selection);     int[] ranges = getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection(selStart, selLimit);     // ranges[0], ranges[1] is the first selection range,     // ranges[2], ranges[3] is the second selection range, etc.   Note: Font rotations can cause text baselines to be rotated, and multiple runs with different rotations can cause the baseline to bend or zig-zag. In order to account for this (rare) possibility, some APIs are specified to return metrics and take parameters 'in baseline-relative coordinates' (e.g. ascent, advance), and others are in 'in standard coordinates' (e.g. getBounds). Values in baseline-relative coordinates map the 'x' coordinate to the distance along the baseline, (positive x is forward along the baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance along the perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (postitive y is 90 degrees clockwise from the baseline vector). Values in standard coordinates are measured along the x and y axes, with 0,0 at the origin of the TextLayout. Documentation for each relevant API indicates what values are in what coordinate system. In general, measurement-related APIs are in baseline-relative coordinates, while display-related APIs are in standard coordinates.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final TextLayout.CaretPolicy DEFAULT_CARET_POLICY
				</name>
				<description>
					This CaretPolicy is used when a policy is not specified by the client. With this policy, a hit on a character whose direction is the same as the line direction is stronger than a hit on a counterdirectional character. If the characters' directions are the same, a hit on the leading edge of a character is stronger than a hit on the trailing edge of a character.

					public TextLayout getJustifiedLayout(float justificationWidth)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a copy of this TextLayout justified to the specified width. If this TextLayout has already been justified, an exception is thrown. If this TextLayout object's justification ratio is zero, a TextLayout identical to this TextLayout is returned.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected void handleJustify(float justificationWidth)
				</name>
				<description>
					Justify this layout. Overridden by subclassers to control justification (if there were subclassers, that is...) The layout will only justify if the paragraph attributes (from the source text, possibly defaulted by the layout attributes) indicate a non-zero justification ratio. The text will be justified to the indicated width. The current implementation also adjusts hanging punctuation and trailing whitespace to overhang the justification width. Once justified, the layout may not be rejustified. Some code may rely on immutablity of layouts. Subclassers should not call this directly, but instead should call getJustifiedLayout, which will call this method on a clone of this layout, preserving the original.

					public Rectangle getPixelBounds(FontRenderContext frc,                         float x,                         float y)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the pixel bounds of this TextLayout when rendered in a graphics with the given FontRenderContext at the given location. The graphics render context need not be the same as the FontRenderContext used to create this TextLayout, and can be null. If it is null, the FontRenderContext of this TextLayout is used.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isLeftToRight()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this TextLayout has a left-to-right base direction or false if it has a right-to-left base direction. The TextLayout has a base direction of either left-to-right (LTR) or right-to-left (RTL). The base direction is independent of the actual direction of text on the line, which may be either LTR, RTL, or mixed. Left-to-right layouts by default should position flush left. If the layout is on a tabbed line, the tabs run left to right, so that logically successive layouts position left to right. The opposite is true for RTL layouts. By default they should position flush left, and tabs run right-to-left.

					public int[] getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection(TextHitInfo firstEndpoint,                                         TextHitInfo secondEndpoint)

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a path enclosing the visual selection in the specified range, extended to bounds. If the selection includes the leftmost (topmost) position, the selection is extended to the left (top) of bounds. If the selection includes the rightmost (bottommost) position, the selection is extended to the right (bottom) of the bounds. The height (width on vertical lines) of the selection is always extended to bounds. Although the selection is always contiguous, the logically selected text can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text. The logical ranges of text selected can be retrieved using getLogicalRangesForVisualSelection. For example, consider the text 'ABCdef' where capital letters indicate right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line, with a visual selection from 0L (the leading edge of 'A') to 3T (the trailing edge of 'd'). The text appears as follows, with bold underlined areas representing the selection:       defCBA    The logical selection ranges are 0-3, 4-6 (ABC, ef) because the visually contiguous text is logically discontiguous. Also note that since the rightmost position on the layout (to the right of 'A') is selected, the selection is extended to the right of the bounds.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Shape enclosing the logical selection in the specified range, extended to the specified bounds. If the selection range includes the first logical character, the selection is extended to the portion of bounds before the start of this TextLayout. If the range includes the last logical character, the selection is extended to the portion of bounds after the end of this TextLayout. The height (width on vertical lines) of the selection is always extended to bounds. The selection can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text. Only those characters in the logical range between start and limit appear selected. For example, consider the text 'ABCdef' where capital letters indicate right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line, with a logical selection from 0 to 4 ('ABCd'). The text appears as follows, with bold standing in for the selection, and underlining for the extension:       defCBA    The selection is discontiguous because the selected characters are visually discontiguous. Also note that since the range includes the first logical character (A), the selection is extended to the portion of the bounds before the start of the layout, which in this case (a right-to-left line) is the right portion of the bounds.
