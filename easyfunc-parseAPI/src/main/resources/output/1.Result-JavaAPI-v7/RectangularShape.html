		<description>
			RectangularShape is the base class for a number of Shape objects whose geometry is defined by a rectangular frame. This class does not directly specify any specific geometry by itself, but merely provides manipulation methods inherited by a whole category of Shape objects. The manipulation methods provided by this class can be used to query and modify the rectangular frame, which provides a reference for the subclasses to define their geometry.

					public boolean contains(Point2D p)

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean intersects(Rectangle2D r)
				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the interior of the Shape intersects the interior of a specified Rectangle2D. The Shape.intersects() method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return true when: there is a high probability that the Rectangle2D and the Shape intersect, but the calculations to accurately determine this intersection are prohibitively expensive. This means that for some Shapes this method might return true even though the Rectangle2D does not intersect the Shape. The Area class performs more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean contains(Rectangle2D r)
				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the interior of the Shape entirely contains the specified Rectangle2D. The Shape.contains() method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return false when: the intersect method returns true and the calculations to determine whether or not the Shape entirely contains the Rectangle2D are prohibitively expensive. This means that for some Shapes this method might return false even though the Shape contains the Rectangle2D. The Area class performs more accurate geometric computations than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Rectangle getBounds()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an integer Rectangle that completely encloses the Shape. Note that there is no guarantee that the returned Rectangle is the smallest bounding box that encloses the Shape, only that the Shape lies entirely within the indicated Rectangle. The returned Rectangle might also fail to completely enclose the Shape if the Shape overflows the limited range of the integer data type. The getBounds2D method generally returns a tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in representation. Note that the definition of insideness can lead to situations where points on the defining outline of the shape may not be considered contained in the returned bounds object, but only in cases where those points are also not considered contained in the original shape. If a point is inside the shape according to the contains(point) method, then it must be inside the returned Rectangle bounds object according to the contains(point) method of the bounds. Specifically: shape.contains(x,y) requires bounds.contains(x,y) If a point is not inside the shape, then it might still be contained in the bounds object: bounds.contains(x,y) does not imply shape.contains(x,y)

				<name>
					public PathIterator getPathIterator(AffineTransform at,                             double flatness)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an iterator object that iterates along the Shape object's boundary and provides access to a flattened view of the outline of the Shape object's geometry. Only SEG_MOVETO, SEG_LINETO, and SEG_CLOSE point types will be returned by the iterator. The amount of subdivision of the curved segments is controlled by the flatness parameter, which specifies the maximum distance that any point on the unflattened transformed curve can deviate from the returned flattened path segments. An optional AffineTransform can be specified so that the coordinates returned in the iteration are transformed accordingly.
