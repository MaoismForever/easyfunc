		<description>
			An XPathFactory instance can be used to create XPath objects. See newInstance(String uri) for lookup mechanism. The XPathFactory class is not thread-safe. In other words, it is the application's responsibility to ensure that at most one thread is using a XPathFactory object at any given moment. Implementations are encouraged to mark methods as synchronized to protect themselves from broken clients. XPathFactory is not re-entrant. While one of the newInstance methods is being invoked, applications may not attempt to recursively invoke a newInstance method, even from the same thread.

					Default Object Model URI.

				<description>
					Protected constructor as newInstance() or newInstance(String uri) or newInstance(String uri, String factoryClassName, ClassLoader classLoader) should be used to create a new instance of an XPathFactory.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final XPathFactory newInstance()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get a new XPathFactory instance using the default object model, DEFAULT_OBJECT_MODEL_URI, the W3C DOM. This method is functionally equivalent to:      newInstance(DEFAULT_OBJECT_MODEL_URI)   Since the implementation for the W3C DOM is always available, this method will never fail.

					public static final XPathFactory newInstance(String uri)                                        throws XPathFactoryConfigurationException
				</name>
				<description>
					Get a new XPathFactory instance using the specified object model. To find a XPathFactory object, this method looks the following places in the following order where "the class loader" refers to the context class loader: If the system property DEFAULT_PROPERTY_NAME + ":uri" is present, where uri is the parameter to this method, then its value is read as a class name. The method will try to create a new instance of this class by using the class loader, and returns it if it is successfully created. ${java.home}/lib/jaxp.properties is read and the value associated with the key being the system property above is looked for. If present, the value is processed just like above. The class loader is asked for service provider provider-configuration files matching javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory in the resource directory META-INF/services. See the JAR File Specification for file format and parsing rules. Each potential service provider is required to implement the method:          isObjectModelSupported(String objectModel)       The first service provider found in class loader order that supports the specified object model is returned. Platform default XPathFactory is located in a platform specific way. There must be a platform default XPathFactory for the W3C DOM, i.e. DEFAULT_OBJECT_MODEL_URI. If everything fails, an XPathFactoryConfigurationException will be thrown. Tip for Trouble-shooting: See Properties.load(java.io.InputStream) for exactly how a property file is parsed. In particular, colons ':' need to be escaped in a property file, so make sure the URIs are properly escaped in it. For example:      http\://java.sun.com/jaxp/xpath/dom=org.acme.DomXPathFactory

					public static XPathFactory newInstance(String uri,                         String factoryClassName,                         ClassLoader classLoader)                                  throws XPathFactoryConfigurationException
				</name>
				<description>
					Obtain a new instance of a XPathFactory from a factory class name. XPathFactory is returned if specified factory class supports the specified object model. This function is useful when there are multiple providers in the classpath. It gives more control to the application as it can specify which provider should be loaded. Tip for Trouble-shooting Setting the jaxp.debug system property will cause this method to print a lot of debug messages to System.err about what it is doing and where it is looking at. If you have problems try:    java -Djaxp.debug=1 YourProgram ....

				</name>
				<description>
					Set a feature for this XPathFactory and XPaths created by this factory. Feature names are fully qualified URIs. Implementations may define their own features. An XPathFactoryConfigurationException is thrown if this XPathFactory or the XPaths it creates cannot support the feature. It is possible for an XPathFactory to expose a feature value but be unable to change its state. All implementations are required to support the XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING feature. When the feature is true, any reference to an external function is an error. Under these conditions, the implementation must not call the XPathFunctionResolver and must throw an XPathFunctionException.
