		<description>
			Interface AttributeException is a mixin interface which a subclass of PrintException can implement to report an error condition involving one or more printing attributes that a particular Print Service instance does not support. Either the attribute is not supported at all, or the attribute is supported but the particular specified value is not supported. The Print Service API does not define any print exception classes that implement interface AttributeException, that being left to the Print Service implementor's discretion.
