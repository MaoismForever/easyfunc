		<description>
			This interface represents an X.509 extension. Extensions provide a means of associating additional attributes with users or public keys and for managing a certification hierarchy. The extension format also allows communities to define private extensions to carry information unique to those communities. Each extension contains an object identifier, a criticality setting indicating whether it is a critical or a non-critical extension, and and an ASN.1 DER-encoded value. Its ASN.1 definition is:          Extension ::= SEQUENCE {           extnId        OBJECT IDENTIFIER,           critical      BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,           extnValue     OCTET STRING                   -- contains a DER encoding of a value                   -- of the type registered for use with                   -- the extnId object identifier value       }     This interface is designed to provide access to a single extension, unlike X509Extension which is more suitable for accessing a set of extensions.
