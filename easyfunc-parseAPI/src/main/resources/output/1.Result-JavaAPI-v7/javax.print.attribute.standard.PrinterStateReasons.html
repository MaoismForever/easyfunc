		<description>
			Class PrinterStateReasons is a printing attribute class, a set of enumeration values, that provides additional information about the printer's current state, i.e., information that augments the value of the printer's PrinterState attribute. Instances of PrinterStateReason do not appear in a Print Service's attribute set directly. Rather, a PrinterStateReasons attribute appears in the Print Service's attribute set. The PrinterStateReasons attribute contains zero, one, or more than one PrinterStateReason objects which pertain to the Print Service's status, and each PrinterStateReason object is associated with a Severity level of REPORT (least severe), WARNING, or ERROR (most severe). The printer adds a PrinterStateReason object to the Print Service's PrinterStateReasons attribute when the corresponding condition becomes true of the printer, and the printer removes the PrinterStateReason object again when the corresponding condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Service's overall PrinterState also changed. Class PrinterStateReasons inherits its implementation from class java.util.HashMap. Each entry in the map consists of a PrinterStateReason object (key) mapping to a Severity object (value): Unlike most printing attributes which are immutable once constructed, class PrinterStateReasons is designed to be mutable; you can add PrinterStateReason objects to an existing PrinterStateReasons object and remove them again. However, like class java.util.HashMap, class PrinterStateReasons is not multiple thread safe. If a PrinterStateReasons object will be used by multiple threads, be sure to synchronize its operations (e.g., using a synchronized map view obtained from class java.util.Collections). IPP Compatibility: The string values returned by each individual PrinterStateReason object's and the associated Severity object's toString() methods, concatenated together with a hyphen ("-") in between, gives the IPP keyword value. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.

			<method>
				<name>
					public PrinterStateReasons(int initialCapacity,                     float loadFactor)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a new, empty printer state reasons attribute; the underlying hash map has the given initial capacity and load factor.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public PrinterStateReasons(Map<PrinterStateReason,Severity> map)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a new printer state reasons attribute that contains the same PrinterStateReason-to-Severity mappings as the given map. The underlying hash map's initial capacity and load factor are as specified in the superclass constructor HashMap(Map).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Severity put(PrinterStateReason reason,             Severity severity)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the given printer state reason to this printer state reasons attribute, associating it with the given severity level. If this printer state reasons attribute previously contained a mapping for the given printer state reason, the old value is replaced.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final Class<? extends Attribute> getCategory()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the printing attribute class which is to be used as the "category" for this printing attribute value. For class PrinterStateReasons, the category is class PrinterStateReasons itself.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final String getName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the name of the category of which this attribute value is an instance. For class PrinterStateReasons, the category name is "printer-state-reasons".
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Set<PrinterStateReason> printerStateReasonSet(Severity severity)
				</name>
				<description>
					Obtain an unmodifiable set view of the individual printer state reason attributes at the given severity level in this PrinterStateReasons attribute. Each element in the set view is a PrinterStateReason object. The only elements in the set view are the PrinterStateReason objects that map to the given severity value. The set view is backed by this PrinterStateReasons attribute, so changes to this PrinterStateReasons attribute are reflected in the set view. The set view does not support element insertion or removal. The set view's iterator does not support element removal.
