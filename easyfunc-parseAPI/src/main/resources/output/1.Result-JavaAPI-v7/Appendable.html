			public interface Appendable
		</name>
		<description>
			An object to which char sequences and values can be appended. The Appendable interface must be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to receive formatted output from a Formatter. The characters to be appended should be valid Unicode characters as described in Unicode Character Representation. Note that supplementary characters may be composed of multiple 16-bit char values. Appendables are not necessarily safe for multithreaded access. Thread safety is the responsibility of classes that extend and implement this interface. Since this interface may be implemented by existing classes with different styles of error handling there is no guarantee that errors will be propagated to the invoker.

			<method>
				<name>
					Appendable append(CharSequence csq)                    throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends the specified character sequence to this Appendable. Depending on which class implements the character sequence csq, the entire sequence may not be appended. For instance, if csq is a CharBuffer then the subsequence to append is defined by the buffer's position and limit.

					Appendable append(CharSequence csq,                  int start,                  int end)                    throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Appends a subsequence of the specified character sequence to this Appendable. An invocation of this method of the form out.append(csq, start, end) when csq is not null, behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation        out.append(csq.subSequence(start, end))
