			public interface DragSourceMotionListener  extends EventListener
		</name>
		<description>
			A listener interface for receiving mouse motion events during a drag operation. The class that is interested in processing mouse motion events during a drag operation either implements this interface or extends the abstract DragSourceAdapter class (overriding only the methods of interest). Create a listener object using that class and then register it with a DragSource. Whenever the mouse moves during a drag operation initiated with this DragSource, that object's dragMouseMoved method is invoked, and the DragSourceDragEvent is passed to it.
