			public interface CRLSelector  extends Cloneable
		</name>
		<description>
			A selector that defines a set of criteria for selecting CRLs. Classes that implement this interface are often used to specify which CRLs should be retrieved from a CertStore. Concurrent Access Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this interface are not thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating separate objects need not synchronize.
