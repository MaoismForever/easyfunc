		<description>
			The Holder for Short. For more information on Holder files, see "Generated Files: Holder Files". short that is used to store "out" and "inout" parameters in IDL operations. If an IDL operation signature has an IDL short as an "out" or "inout" parameter, the programmer must pass an instance of ShortHolder as the corresponding parameter in the method invocation; for "inout" parameters, the programmer must also fill the "in" value to be sent to the server. Before the method invocation returns, the ORB will fill in the value corresponding to the "out" value returned from the server. If myShortHolder is an instance of ShortHolder, the value stored in its value field can be accessed with myShortHolder.value.
