		<description>
			SAX2 extension to augment the per-attribute information provided though Attributes. If an implementation supports this extension, the attributes provided in ContentHandler.startElement() will implement this interface, and the http://xml.org/sax/features/use-attributes2 feature flag will have the value true. This module, both source code and documentation, is in the Public Domain, and comes with NO WARRANTY. XMLReader implementations are not required to support this information, and it is not part of core-only SAX2 distributions. Note that if an attribute was defaulted (!isSpecified()) it will of necessity also have been declared (isDeclared()) in the DTD. Similarly if an attribute's type is anything except CDATA, then it must have been declared.

					boolean isDeclared(int index)

				<description>
					Returns false unless the attribute was declared in the DTD. This helps distinguish two kinds of attributes that SAX reports as CDATA: ones that were declared (and hence are usually valid), and those that were not (and which are never valid).

				<description>
					Returns false unless the attribute was declared in the DTD. This helps distinguish two kinds of attributes that SAX reports as CDATA: ones that were declared (and hence are usually valid), and those that were not (and which are never valid). Remember that since DTDs do not "understand" namespaces, the namespace URI associated with an attribute may not have come from the DTD. The declaration will have applied to the attribute's qName.
