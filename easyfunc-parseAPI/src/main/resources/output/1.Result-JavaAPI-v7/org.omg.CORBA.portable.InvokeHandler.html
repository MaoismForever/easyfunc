					OutputStream _invoke(String method,                     InputStream input,                     ResponseHandler handler)                       throws SystemException

				<description>
					Invoked by the ORB to dispatch a request to the servant. ORB passes the method name, an InputStream containing the marshalled arguments, and a ResponseHandler which the servant uses to construct a proper reply. Only CORBA SystemException may be thrown by this method. The method must return an OutputStream created by the ResponseHandler which contains the marshalled reply. A servant must not retain a reference to the ResponseHandler beyond the lifetime of a method invocation. Servant behaviour is defined as follows: 1. Determine correct method, and unmarshal parameters from InputStream. 2. Invoke method implementation. 3. If no user exception, create a normal reply using ResponseHandler. 4. If user exception occurred, create exception reply using ResponseHandler. 5. Marshal reply into OutputStream returned by ResponseHandler. 6. Return OutputStream to ORB.
