			public class NotContextException  extends NamingException
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception is thrown when a naming operation proceeds to a point where a context is required to continue the operation, but the resolved object is not a context. For example, Context.destroy() requires that the named object be a context. If it is not, NotContextException is thrown. Another example is a non-context being encountered during the resolution phase of the Context methods. It is also thrown when a particular subtype of context is required, such as a DirContext, and the resolved object is a context but not of the required subtype. Synchronization and serialization issues that apply to NamingException apply directly here.
