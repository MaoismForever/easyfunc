		<description>
			A skeletal visitor for annotation values with default behavior appropriate for the RELEASE_7 source version. WARNING: The AnnotationValueVisitor interface implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to future versions of the Java™ programming language. Therefore, methods whose names begin with "visit" may be added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities, classes which extend this class should not declare any instance methods with names beginning with "visit". When such a new visit method is added, the default implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method. A new abstract annotation value visitor class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the visit method in question. When the new visitor is introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
