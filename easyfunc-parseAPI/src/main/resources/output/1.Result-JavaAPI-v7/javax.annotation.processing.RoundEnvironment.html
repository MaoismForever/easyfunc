			<method>
				<name>
					boolean맗rocessingOver()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if types generated by this round will not be subject to a subsequent round of annotation processing; returns false otherwise.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean만rrorRaised()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if an error was raised in the prior round of processing; returns false otherwise.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Set<? extends Element>많etRootElements()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the root elements for annotation processing generated by the prior round.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Set<? extends Element>많etElementsAnnotatedWith(TypeElement마)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the elements annotated with the given annotation type. The annotation may appear directly or be inherited. Only package elements and type elements included in this round of annotation processing, or declarations of members, constructors, parameters, or type parameters declared within those, are returned. Included type elements are root types and any member types nested within them. Elements in a package are not considered included simply because a package-info file for that package was created.
