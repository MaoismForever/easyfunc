			public class AuthenticationException  extends SaslException
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception is thrown by a SASL mechanism implementation to indicate that the SASL exchange has failed due to reasons related to authentication, such as an invalid identity, passphrase, or key. Note that the lack of an AuthenticationException does not mean that the failure was not due to an authentication error. A SASL mechanism implementation might throw the more general SaslException instead of AuthenticationException if it is unable to determine the nature of the failure, or if does not want to disclose the nature of the failure, for example, due to security reasons.
