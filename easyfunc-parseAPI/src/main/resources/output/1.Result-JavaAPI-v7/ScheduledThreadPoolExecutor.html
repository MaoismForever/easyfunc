			public class ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor  extends ThreadPoolExecutor  implements ScheduledExecutorService
		</name>
		<description>
			A ThreadPoolExecutor that can additionally schedule commands to run after a given delay, or to execute periodically. This class is preferable to Timer when multiple worker threads are needed, or when the additional flexibility or capabilities of ThreadPoolExecutor (which this class extends) are required. Delayed tasks execute no sooner than they are enabled, but without any real-time guarantees about when, after they are enabled, they will commence. Tasks scheduled for exactly the same execution time are enabled in first-in-first-out (FIFO) order of submission. When a submitted task is cancelled before it is run, execution is suppressed. By default, such a cancelled task is not automatically removed from the work queue until its delay elapses. While this enables further inspection and monitoring, it may also cause unbounded retention of cancelled tasks. To avoid this, set setRemoveOnCancelPolicy(boolean) to true, which causes tasks to be immediately removed from the work queue at time of cancellation. Successive executions of a task scheduled via scheduleAtFixedRate or scheduleWithFixedDelay do not overlap. While different executions may be performed by different threads, the effects of prior executions happen-before those of subsequent ones. While this class inherits from ThreadPoolExecutor, a few of the inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In particular, because it acts as a fixed-sized pool using corePoolSize threads and an unbounded queue, adjustments to maximumPoolSize have no useful effect. Additionally, it is almost never a good idea to set corePoolSize to zero or use allowCoreThreadTimeOut because this may leave the pool without threads to handle tasks once they become eligible to run. Extension notes: This class overrides the execute and submit methods to generate internal ScheduledFuture objects to control per-task delays and scheduling. To preserve functionality, any further overrides of these methods in subclasses must invoke superclass versions, which effectively disables additional task customization. However, this class provides alternative protected extension method decorateTask (one version each for Runnable and Callable) that can be used to customize the concrete task types used to execute commands entered via execute, submit, schedule, scheduleAtFixedRate, and scheduleWithFixedDelay. By default, a ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor uses a task type extending FutureTask. However, this may be modified or replaced using subclasses of the form:  public class CustomScheduledExecutor extends ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor {       static class CustomTask<V> implements RunnableScheduledFuture<V> { ... }       protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(                  Runnable r, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {         return new CustomTask<V>(r, task);     }       protected <V> RunnableScheduledFuture<V> decorateTask(                  Callable<V> c, RunnableScheduledFuture<V> task) {         return new CustomTask<V>(c, task);     }     // ... add constructors, etc.   }

				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ScheduledExecutorService Creates and executes a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the given initial delay, and subsequently with the given period; that is executions will commence after initialDelay then initialDelay+period, then initialDelay + 2 * period, and so on. If any execution of the task encounters an exception, subsequent executions are suppressed. Otherwise, the task will only terminate via cancellation or termination of the executor. If any execution of this task takes longer than its period, then subsequent executions may start late, but will not concurrently execute.

				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ScheduledExecutorService Creates and executes a periodic action that becomes enabled first after the given initial delay, and subsequently with the given delay between the termination of one execution and the commencement of the next. If any execution of the task encounters an exception, subsequent executions are suppressed. Otherwise, the task will only terminate via cancellation or termination of the executor.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void execute(Runnable command)
				</name>
				<description>
					Executes command with zero required delay. This has effect equivalent to schedule(command, 0, anyUnit). Note that inspections of the queue and of the list returned by shutdownNow will access the zero-delayed ScheduledFuture, not the command itself. A consequence of the use of ScheduledFuture objects is that afterExecute is always called with a null second Throwable argument, even if the command terminated abruptly. Instead, the Throwable thrown by such a task can be obtained via Future.get().

					public Future<?> submit(Runnable task)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ExecutorService Submits a Runnable task for execution and returns a Future representing that task. The Future's get method will return null upon successful completion.

					public <T> Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: ExecutorService Submits a value-returning task for execution and returns a Future representing the pending results of the task. The Future's get method will return the task's result upon successful completion. If you would like to immediately block waiting for a task, you can use constructions of the form result = exec.submit(aCallable).get(); Note: The Executors class includes a set of methods that can convert some other common closure-like objects, for example, PrivilegedAction to Callable form so they can be submitted.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setContinueExistingPeriodicTasksAfterShutdownPolicy(boolean value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the policy on whether to continue executing existing periodic tasks even when this executor has been shutdown. In this case, these tasks will only terminate upon shutdownNow or after setting the policy to false when already shutdown. This value is by default false.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy(boolean value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the policy on whether to execute existing delayed tasks even when this executor has been shutdown. In this case, these tasks will only terminate upon shutdownNow, or after setting the policy to false when already shutdown. This value is by default true.

				<name>
					public void setRemoveOnCancelPolicy(boolean value)

					public boolean getRemoveOnCancelPolicy()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the policy on whether cancelled tasks should be immediately removed from the work queue at time of cancellation. This value is by default false.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void shutdown()
				</name>
				<description>
					Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted. Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down. This method does not wait for previously submitted tasks to complete execution. Use awaitTermination to do that. If the ExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy has been set false, existing delayed tasks whose delays have not yet elapsed are cancelled. And unless the ContinueExistingPeriodicTasksAfterShutdownPolicy has been set true, future executions of existing periodic tasks will be cancelled.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public List<Runnable> shutdownNow()
				</name>
				<description>
					Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks that were awaiting execution. This method does not wait for actively executing tasks to terminate. Use awaitTermination to do that. There are no guarantees beyond best-effort attempts to stop processing actively executing tasks. This implementation cancels tasks via Thread.interrupt(), so any task that fails to respond to interrupts may never terminate.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public BlockingQueue<Runnable> getQueue()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the task queue used by this executor. Each element of this queue is a ScheduledFuture, including those tasks submitted using execute which are for scheduling purposes used as the basis of a zero-delay ScheduledFuture. Iteration over this queue is not guaranteed to traverse tasks in the order in which they will execute.
