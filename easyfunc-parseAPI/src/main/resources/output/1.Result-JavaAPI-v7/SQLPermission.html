			The permission for which the SecurityManager will check when code that is running in an applet, or an application with a SecurityManager enabled, calls the DriverManager.setLogWriter method, DriverManager.setLogStream (deprecated) method, SyncFactory.setJNDIContext method, SyncFactory.setLogger method, Connection.setNetworktimeout method, or the Connection.abort method. If there is no SQLPermission object, these methods throw a java.lang.SecurityException as a runtime exception. A SQLPermission object contains a name (also referred to as a "target name") but no actions list; there is either a named permission or there is not. The target name is the name of the permission (see below). The naming convention follows the hierarchical property naming convention. In addition, an asterisk may appear at the end of the name, following a ".", or by itself, to signify a wildcard match. For example: loadLibrary.* or * is valid, but *loadLibrary or a*b is not valid. The following table lists all the possible SQLPermission target names. The table gives a description of what the permission allows and a discussion of the risks of granting code the permission. Permission Target Name What the Permission Allows Risks of Allowing this Permission setLog Setting of the logging stream This is a dangerous permission to grant. The contents of the log may contain usernames and passwords, SQL statements, and SQL data. callAbort Allows the invocation of the Connection method abort Permits an application to terminate a physical connection to a database. setSyncFactory Allows the invocation of the SyncFactory methods setJNDIContext and setLogger Permits an application to specify the JNDI context from which the SyncProvider implementations can be retrieved from and the logging object to be used by the SyncProvider implementation. setNetworkTimeout Allows the invocation of the Connection method setNetworkTimeout Permits an application to specify the maximum period a Connection or objects created from the Connection will wait for the database to reply to any one request. The person running an applet decides what permissions to allow and will run the Policy Tool to create an SQLPermission in a policy file. A programmer does not use a constructor directly to create an instance of SQLPermission but rather uses a tool.
