			public class CannotProceedException  extends NamingException
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception is thrown to indicate that the operation reached a point in the name where the operation cannot proceed any further. When performing an operation on a composite name, a naming service provider may reach a part of the name that does not belong to its namespace. At that point, it can construct a CannotProceedException and then invoke methods provided by javax.naming.spi.NamingManager (such as getContinuationContext()) to locate another provider to continue the operation. If this is not possible, this exception is raised to the caller of the context operation. If the program wants to handle this exception in particular, it should catch CannotProceedException explicitly before attempting to catch NamingException. A CannotProceedException instance is not synchronized against concurrent multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify CannotProceedException should lock the object.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected Name remainingNewName
				</name>
				<description>
					Contains the remaining unresolved part of the second "name" argument to Context.rename(). This information necessary for continuing the Context.rename() operation. This field is initialized to null. It should not be manipulated directly: it should be accessed and updated using getRemainingName() and setRemainingName().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected Hashtable<?,?> environment
				</name>
				<description>
					Contains the environment relevant for the Context or DirContext method that cannot proceed. This field is initialized to null. It should not be manipulated directly: it should be accessed and updated using getEnvironment() and setEnvironment().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected Name altName
				</name>
				<description>
					Contains the name of the resolved object, relative to the context altNameCtx. It is a composite name. If null, then no name is specified. See the javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance method for details on how this is used. This field is initialized to null. It should not be manipulated directly: it should be accessed and updated using getAltName() and setAltName().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected Context altNameCtx
				</name>
				<description>
					Contains the context relative to which altName is specified. If null, then the default initial context is implied. See the javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance method for details on how this is used. This field is initialized to null. It should not be manipulated directly: it should be accessed and updated using getAltNameCtx() and setAltNameCtx().

			<method>
				<name>
					public CannotProceedException(String explanation)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new instance of CannotProceedException using an explanation. All unspecified fields default to null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public CannotProceedException()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new instance of CannotProceedException. All fields default to null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Hashtable<?,?> getEnvironment()
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the environment that was in effect when this exception was created.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setEnvironment(Hashtable<?,?> environment)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the environment that will be returned when getEnvironment() is called.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Name getRemainingNewName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the "remaining new name" field of this exception, which is used when this exception is thrown during a rename() operation.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setRemainingNewName(Name newName)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the "remaining new name" field of this exception. This is the value returned by getRemainingNewName(). newName is a composite name. If the intent is to set this field using a compound name or string, you must "stringify" the compound name, and create a composite name with a single component using the string. You can then invoke this method using the resulting composite name. A copy of newName is made and stored. Subsequent changes to name does not affect the copy in this NamingException and vice versa.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Name getAltName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the altName field of this exception. This is the name of the resolved object, relative to the context altNameCtx. It will be used during a subsequent call to the javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setAltName(Name altName)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the altName field of this exception.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Context getAltNameCtx()
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the altNameCtx field of this exception. This is the context relative to which altName is named. It will be used during a subsequent call to the javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setAltNameCtx(Context altNameCtx)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the altNameCtx field of this exception.
