					public SSLSocketFactory()

				<description>
					Constructor is used only by subclasses.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static SocketFactory getDefault()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the default SSL socket factory. The first time this method is called, the security property "ssl.SocketFactory.provider" is examined. If it is non-null, a class by that name is loaded and instantiated. If that is successful and the object is an instance of SSLSocketFactory, it is made the default SSL socket factory. Otherwise, this method returns SSLContext.getDefault().getSocketFactory(). If that call fails, an inoperative factory is returned.

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract String[] getDefaultCipherSuites()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the list of cipher suites which are enabled by default. Unless a different list is enabled, handshaking on an SSL connection will use one of these cipher suites. The minimum quality of service for these defaults requires confidentiality protection and server authentication (that is, no anonymous cipher suites).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract String[] getSupportedCipherSuites()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the names of the cipher suites which could be enabled for use on an SSL connection. Normally, only a subset of these will actually be enabled by default, since this list may include cipher suites which do not meet quality of service requirements for those defaults. Such cipher suites are useful in specialized applications.

					public abstract Socket createSocket(Socket s,                    String host,                    int port,                    boolean autoClose)                               throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a socket layered over an existing socket connected to the named host, at the given port. This constructor can be used when tunneling SSL through a proxy or when negotiating the use of SSL over an existing socket. The host and port refer to the logical peer destination. This socket is configured using the socket options established for this factory.
