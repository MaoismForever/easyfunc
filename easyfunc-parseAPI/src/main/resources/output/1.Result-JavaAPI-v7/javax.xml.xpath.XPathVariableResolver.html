		<description>
			XPathVariableResolver provides access to the set of user defined XPath variables. The XPathVariableResolver and the XPath evaluator must adhere to a contract that cannot be directly enforced by the API. Although variables may be mutable, that is, an application may wish to evaluate the same XPath expression more than once with different variable values, in the course of evaluating any single XPath expression, a variable's value must not change.
