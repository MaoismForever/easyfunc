			public static enum AddressingFeature.Responses  extends Enum<AddressingFeature.Responses>

		<description>
			If addressing is enabled, this property determines if endpoint requires the use of only anonymous responses, or only non-anonymous responses, or all. ALL supports all response types and this is the default value. ANONYMOUS requires the use of only anonymous responses. It will result into wsam:AnonymousResponses nested assertion as specified in 3.1.2 AnonymousResponses Assertion in the generated WSDL. NON_ANONYMOUS requires the use of only non-anonymous responses. It will result into wsam:NonAnonymousResponses nested assertion as specified in 3.1.3 NonAnonymousResponses Assertion in the generated WSDL.
