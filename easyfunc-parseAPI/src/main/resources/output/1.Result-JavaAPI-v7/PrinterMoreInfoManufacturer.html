		<description>
			Class PrinterMoreInfoManufacturer is a printing attribute class, a URI, that is used to obtain more information about this type of device. The information obtained from this URI is intended for end user consumption. Features outside the scope of the Print Service API can be accessed from this URI (e.g., latest firmware, upgrades, service proxies, optional features available, details on color support). The information is intended to be germane to this kind of printer without regard to site specific modifications or services. PrinterMoreInfo attribute is used to find out more information about this specific printer rather than this general kind of printer. IPP Compatibility: The string form returned by toString() gives the IPP uri value. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.
