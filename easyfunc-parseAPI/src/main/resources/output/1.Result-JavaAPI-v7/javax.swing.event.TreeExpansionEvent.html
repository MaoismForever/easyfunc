		<description>
			An event used to identify a single path in a tree. The source returned by getSource will be an instance of JTree. For further documentation and examples see the following sections in The Java Tutorial: How to Write a Tree Expansion Listener and How to Write a Tree-Will-Expand Listener. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
