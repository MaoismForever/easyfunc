		<description>
			Class JobMediaSheetsSupported is a printing attribute class, a set of integers, that gives the supported values for a JobMediaSheets attribute. It is restricted to a single contiguous range of integers; multiple non-overlapping ranges are not allowed. This gives the lower and upper bounds of the total sizes of print jobs in number of media sheets that the printer will accept. IPP Compatibility: The JobMediaSheetsSupported attribute's canonical array form gives the lower and upper bound for the range of values to be included in an IPP "job-media-sheets-supported" attribute. See class SetOfIntegerSyntax for an explanation of canonical array form. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.

					public JobMediaSheetsSupported(int lowerBound,                         int upperBound)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a new job media sheets supported attribute containing a single range of integers. That is, only those values of JobMediaSheets in the one range are supported.

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean equals(Object object)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether this job media sheets supported attribute is equivalent to the passed in object. To be equivalent, all of the following conditions must be true: object is not null. object is an instance of class JobMediaSheetsSupported. This job media sheets supported attribute's members and object's members are the same.

					public final Class<? extends Attribute> getCategory()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the printing attribute class which is to be used as the "category" for this printing attribute value. For class JobMediaSheetsSupported, the category is class JobMediaSheetsSupported itself.
