		<description>
			Input method events contain information about text that is being composed using an input method. Whenever the text changes, the input method sends an event. If the text component that's currently using the input method is an active client, the event is dispatched to that component. Otherwise, it is dispatched to a separate composition window. The text included with the input method event consists of two parts: committed text and composed text. Either part may be empty. The two parts together replace any uncommitted composed text sent in previous events, or the currently selected committed text. Committed text should be integrated into the text component's persistent data, it will not be sent again. Composed text may be sent repeatedly, with changes to reflect the user's editing operations. Committed text always precedes composed text.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int INPUT_METHOD_FIRST
				</name>
				<description>
					Marks the first integer id for the range of input method event ids.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED
				</name>
				<description>
					The event type indicating changed input method text. This event is generated by input methods while processing input.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int CARET_POSITION_CHANGED
				</name>
				<description>
					The event type indicating a changed insertion point in input method text. This event is generated by input methods while processing input if only the caret changed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final int INPUT_METHOD_LAST
				</name>
				<description>
					Marks the last integer id for the range of input method event ids.

					public InputMethodEvent(Component source,                  int id,                  long when,                  AttributedCharacterIterator text,                  int committedCharacterCount,                  TextHitInfo caret,                  TextHitInfo visiblePosition)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an InputMethodEvent with the specified source component, type, time, text, caret, and visiblePosition. The offsets of caret and visiblePosition are relative to the current composed text; that is, the composed text within text if this is an INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED event, the composed text within the text of the preceding INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED event otherwise. Note that passing in an invalid id results in unspecified behavior. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an InputMethodEvent with the specified source component, type, text, caret, and visiblePosition. The offsets of caret and visiblePosition are relative to the current composed text; that is, the composed text within text if this is an INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED event, the composed text within the text of the preceding INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED event otherwise. The time stamp for this event is initialized by invoking EventQueue.getMostRecentEventTime(). Note that passing in an invalid id results in unspecified behavior. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null.

					public InputMethodEvent(Component source,                  int id,                  TextHitInfo caret,                  TextHitInfo visiblePosition)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an InputMethodEvent with the specified source component, type, caret, and visiblePosition. The text is set to null, committedCharacterCount to 0. The offsets of caret and visiblePosition are relative to the current composed text; that is, the composed text within the text of the preceding INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED event if the event being constructed as a CARET_POSITION_CHANGED event. For an INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED event without text, caret and visiblePosition must be null. The time stamp for this event is initialized by invoking EventQueue.getMostRecentEventTime(). Note that passing in an invalid id results in unspecified behavior. This method throws an IllegalArgumentException if source is null.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public AttributedCharacterIterator getText()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the combined committed and composed text. Characters from index 0 to index getCommittedCharacterCount() - 1 are committed text, the remaining characters are composed text.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getCommittedCharacterCount()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the number of committed characters in the text.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public TextHitInfo getCaret()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the caret. The offset of the caret is relative to the current composed text; that is, the composed text within getText() if this is an INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED event, the composed text within getText() of the preceding INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED event otherwise.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public TextHitInfo getVisiblePosition()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the position that's most important to be visible. The offset of the visible position is relative to the current composed text; that is, the composed text within getText() if this is an INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED event, the composed text within getText() of the preceding INPUT_METHOD_TEXT_CHANGED event otherwise.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void consume()
				</name>
				<description>
					Consumes this event so that it will not be processed in the default manner by the source which originated it.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isConsumed()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether or not this event has been consumed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public long getWhen()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the time stamp of when this event occurred.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String paramString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a parameter string identifying this event. This method is useful for event-logging and for debugging. It contains the event ID in text form, the characters of the committed and composed text separated by "+", the number of committed characters, the caret, and the visible position.
