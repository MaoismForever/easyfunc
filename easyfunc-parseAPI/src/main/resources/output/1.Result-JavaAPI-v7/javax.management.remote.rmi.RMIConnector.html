			public class RMIConnector  extends Object  implements JMXConnector, Serializable, JMXAddressable
		</name>
		<description>
			A connection to a remote RMI connector. Usually, such connections are made using JMXConnectorFactory. However, specialized applications can use this class directly, for example with an RMIServer stub obtained without going through JNDI.

					public RMIConnector(JMXServiceURL url,              Map<String,?> environment)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an RMIConnector that will connect the RMI connector server with the given address. The address can refer directly to the connector server, using one of the following syntaxes:    service:jmx:rmi://[host[:port]]/stub/encoded-stub   service:jmx:iiop://[host[:port]]/ior/encoded-IOR   (Here, the square brackets [] are not part of the address but indicate that the host and port are optional.) The address can instead indicate where to find an RMI stub through JNDI, using one of the following syntaxes:    service:jmx:rmi://[host[:port]]/jndi/jndi-name   service:jmx:iiop://[host[:port]]/jndi/jndi-name   An implementation may also recognize additional address syntaxes, for example:    service:jmx:iiop://[host[:port]]/stub/encoded-stub

			<method>
				<name>
					public String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this object. In general, the toString method returns a string that "textually represents" this object. The result should be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a person to read.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public JMXServiceURL getAddress()
				</name>
				<description>
					The address of this connector.

					Description copied from interface: JMXConnector Establishes the connection to the connector server. This method is equivalent to connect(null).

					public void connect(Map<String,?> environment)               throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: JMXConnector Establishes the connection to the connector server. If connect has already been called successfully on this object, calling it again has no effect. If, however, JMXConnector.close() was called after connect, the new connect will throw an IOException. Otherwise, either connect has never been called on this object, or it has been called but produced an exception. Then calling connect will attempt to establish a connection to the connector server.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: JMXConnector Gets this connection's ID from the connector server. For a given connector server, every connection will have a unique id which does not change during the lifetime of the connection.

					public MBeanServerConnection getMBeanServerConnection()                                                 throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: JMXConnector Returns an MBeanServerConnection object representing a remote MBean server. For a given JMXConnector, two successful calls to this method will usually return the same MBeanServerConnection object, though this is not required. For each method in the returned MBeanServerConnection, calling the method causes the corresponding method to be called in the remote MBean server. The value returned by the MBean server method is the value returned to the client. If the MBean server method produces an Exception, the same Exception is seen by the client. If the MBean server method, or the attempt to call it, produces an Error, the Error is wrapped in a JMXServerErrorException, which is seen by the client. Calling this method is equivalent to calling getMBeanServerConnection(null) meaning that no delegation subject is specified and that all the operations called on the MBeanServerConnection must use the authenticated subject, if any.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: JMXConnector Returns an MBeanServerConnection object representing a remote MBean server on which operations are performed on behalf of the supplied delegation subject. For a given JMXConnector and Subject, two successful calls to this method will usually return the same MBeanServerConnection object, though this is not required. For each method in the returned MBeanServerConnection, calling the method causes the corresponding method to be called in the remote MBean server on behalf of the given delegation subject instead of the authenticated subject. The value returned by the MBean server method is the value returned to the client. If the MBean server method produces an Exception, the same Exception is seen by the client. If the MBean server method, or the attempt to call it, produces an Error, the Error is wrapped in a JMXServerErrorException, which is seen by the client.

					public void addConnectionNotificationListener(NotificationListener listener,                                       NotificationFilter filter,                                       Object handback)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: JMXConnector Adds a listener to be informed of changes in connection status. The listener will receive notifications of type JMXConnectionNotification. An implementation can send other types of notifications too. Any number of listeners can be added with this method. The same listener can be added more than once with the same or different values for the filter and handback. There is no special treatment of a duplicate entry. For example, if a listener is registered twice with no filter, then its handleNotification method will be called twice for each notification.

				<description>
					Description copied from interface: JMXConnector Removes a listener from the list to be informed of changes in status. The listener must previously have been added. If there is more than one matching listener, all are removed.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: JMXConnector Removes a listener from the list to be informed of changes in status. The listener must previously have been added with the same three parameters. If there is more than one matching listener, only one is removed.

					public void close()             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: JMXConnector Closes the client connection to its server. Any ongoing or new request using the MBeanServerConnection returned by JMXConnector.getMBeanServerConnection() will get an IOException. If close has already been called successfully on this object, calling it again has no effect. If close has never been called, or if it was called but produced an exception, an attempt will be made to close the connection. This attempt can succeed, in which case close will return normally, or it can generate an exception. Closing a connection is a potentially slow operation. For example, if the server has crashed, the close operation might have to wait for a network protocol timeout. Callers that do not want to block in a close operation should do it in a separate thread.
