		</name>
		<description>
			A file attribute view that provides a view of the legacy "DOS" file attributes. These attributes are supported by file systems such as the File Allocation Table (FAT) format commonly used in consumer devices. A DosFileAttributeView is a BasicFileAttributeView that additionally supports access to the set of DOS attribute flags that are used to indicate if the file is read-only, hidden, a system file, or archived. Where dynamic access to file attributes is required, the attributes supported by this attribute view are as defined by BasicFileAttributeView, and in addition, the following attributes are supported: Name Type readonly Boolean hidden Boolean system Boolean archive Boolean The getAttribute method may be used to read any of these attributes, or any of the attributes defined by BasicFileAttributeView as if by invoking the readAttributes() method. The setAttribute method may be used to update the file's last modified time, last access time or create time attributes as defined by BasicFileAttributeView. It may also be used to update the DOS attributes as if by invoking the setReadOnly, setHidden, setSystem, and setArchive methods respectively.

			<method>
				<name>
					String name()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the name of the attribute view. Attribute views of this type have the name "dos".

			<method>
				<name>
					DosFileAttributes readAttributes()                                   throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: BasicFileAttributeView Reads the basic file attributes as a bulk operation. It is implementation specific if all file attributes are read as an atomic operation with respect to other file system operations.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void setReadOnly(boolean value)                   throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Updates the value of the read-only attribute. It is implementation specific if the attribute can be updated as an atomic operation with respect to other file system operations. An implementation may, for example, require to read the existing value of the DOS attribute in order to update this attribute.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					void setHidden(boolean value)                 throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Updates the value of the hidden attribute. It is implementation specific if the attribute can be updated as an atomic operation with respect to other file system operations. An implementation may, for example, require to read the existing value of the DOS attribute in order to update this attribute.

			<method>
				<name>
					void setSystem(boolean value)                 throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Updates the value of the system attribute. It is implementation specific if the attribute can be updated as an atomic operation with respect to other file system operations. An implementation may, for example, require to read the existing value of the DOS attribute in order to update this attribute.

			<method>
				<name>
					void setArchive(boolean value)                  throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Updates the value of the archive attribute. It is implementation specific if the attribute can be updated as an atomic operation with respect to other file system operations. An implementation may, for example, require to read the existing value of the DOS attribute in order to update this attribute.
