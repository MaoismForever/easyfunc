		<description>
			A collection of attributes to associate with an element in a document. Since these are typically used to associate character and paragraph styles with the element, operations for this are provided. Other customized attributes that get associated with the element will effectively be name-value pairs that live in a hierarchy and if a name (key) is not found locally, the request is forwarded to the parent. Commonly used attributes are separated out to facilitate alternative implementations that are more efficient.
