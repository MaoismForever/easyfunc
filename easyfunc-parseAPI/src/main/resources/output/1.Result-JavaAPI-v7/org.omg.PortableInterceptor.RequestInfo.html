		<description>
			Request Information, accessible to Interceptors. Each interception point is given an object through which the Interceptor can access request information. Client-side and server-side interception points are concerned with different information, so there are two information objects: ClientRequestInfo is passed to the client-side interception points and ServerRequestInfo is passed to the server-side interception points. But there is information that is common to both, so they both inherit from a common interface: RequestInfo.
