		<description>
			Enable synchronization between XML infoset nodes and JAXB objects representing same XML document. An instance of this class maintains the association between XML nodes of an infoset preserving view and a JAXB representation of an XML document. Navigation between the two views is provided by the methods getXMLNode(Object) and getJAXBNode(Object). Modifications can be made to either the infoset preserving view or the JAXB representation of the document while the other view remains unmodified. The binder is able to synchronize the changes made in the modified view back into the other view using the appropriate Binder update methods, updateXML(Object, Object) or updateJAXB(Object). A typical usage scenario is the following: load XML document into an XML infoset representation unmarshal(Object) XML infoset view to JAXB view. (Note to conserve resources, it is possible to only unmarshal a subtree of the XML infoset view to the JAXB view.) application access/updates JAXB view of XML document. updateXML(Object) synchronizes modifications to JAXB view back into the XML infoset view. Update operation preserves as much of original XML infoset as possible (i.e. comments, PI, ...) A Binder instance is created using the factory method JAXBContext.createBinder() or JAXBContext.createBinder(Class). The template parameter, XmlNode, is the root interface/class for the XML infoset preserving representation. A Binder implementation is required to minimally support an XmlNode value of org.w3c.dom.Node.class. A Binder implementation can support alternative XML infoset preserving representations.

				<description>
					Unmarshal XML infoset view to a JAXB object tree. This method is similar to Unmarshaller.unmarshal(Node) with the addition of maintaining the association between XML nodes and the produced JAXB objects, enabling future update operations, updateXML(Object, Object) or updateJAXB(Object). When getSchema() is non-null, xmlNode and its descendants is validated during this operation. This method throws UnmarshalException when the Binder's JAXBContext does not have a mapping for the XML element name or the type, specifiable via @xsi:type, of xmlNode to a JAXB mapped class. The method unmarshal(Object, Class) enables an application to specify the JAXB mapped class that the xmlNode should be mapped to.

				<description>
					Marshal a JAXB object tree to a new XML document. This method is similar to Marshaller.marshal(Object, Node) with the addition of maintaining the association between JAXB objects and the produced XML nodes, enabling future update operations such as updateXML(Object, Object) or updateJAXB(Object). When getSchema() is non-null, the marshalled xml content is validated during this operation.

					public abstract XmlNode getXMLNode(Object jaxbObject)
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the XML element associated with the given JAXB object. Once a JAXB object tree is associated with an XML fragment, this method enables navigation between the two trees. An association between an XML element and a JAXB object is established by the bind methods and the update methods. Note that this association is partial; not all XML elements have associated JAXB objects, and not all JAXB objects have associated XML elements.

				</name>
				<description>
					Changes in JAXB object tree are updated in its associated XML parse tree. This operation can be thought of as an "in-place" marshalling. The difference is that instead of creating a whole new XML tree, this operation updates an existing tree while trying to preserve the XML as much as possible. For example, unknown elements/attributes in XML that were not bound to JAXB will be left untouched (whereas a marshalling operation would create a new tree that doesn't contain any of those.) As a side-effect, this operation updates the association between XML nodes and JAXB objects.

				<description>
					Takes an XML node and updates its associated JAXB object and its descendants. This operation can be thought of as an "in-place" unmarshalling. The difference is that instead of creating a whole new JAXB tree, this operation updates an existing tree, reusing as much JAXB objects as possible. As a side-effect, this operation updates the association between XML nodes and JAXB objects.

					Allow an application to register a ValidationEventHandler. The ValidationEventHandler will be called by the JAXB Provider if any validation errors are encountered during calls to any of the Binder unmarshal, marshal and update methods. Calling this method with a null parameter will cause the Binder to revert back to the default default event handler.
