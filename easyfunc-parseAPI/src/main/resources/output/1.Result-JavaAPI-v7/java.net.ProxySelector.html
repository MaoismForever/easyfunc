			public abstract class ProxySelector  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			Selects the proxy server to use, if any, when connecting to the network resource referenced by a URL. A proxy selector is a concrete sub-class of this class and is registered by invoking the setDefault method. The currently registered proxy selector can be retrieved by calling getDefault method. When a proxy selector is registered, for instance, a subclass of URLConnection class should call the select method for each URL request so that the proxy selector can decide if a direct, or proxied connection should be used. The select method returns an iterator over a collection with the preferred connection approach. If a connection cannot be established to a proxy (PROXY or SOCKS) servers then the caller should call the proxy selector's connectFailed method to notify the proxy selector that the proxy server is unavailable. The default proxy selector does enforce a set of System Properties related to proxy settings.

					public abstract List<Proxy> select(URI uri)
				</name>
				<description>
					Selects all the applicable proxies based on the protocol to access the resource with and a destination address to access the resource at. The format of the URI is defined as follow: http URI for http connections https URI for https connections ftp URI for ftp connections socket://host:port for tcp client sockets connections
