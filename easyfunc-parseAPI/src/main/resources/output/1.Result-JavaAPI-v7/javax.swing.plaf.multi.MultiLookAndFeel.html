			public class MultiLookAndFeel  extends LookAndFeel
		</name>
		<description>
			A multiplexing look and feel that allows more than one UI to be associated with a component at the same time. The primary look and feel is called the default look and feel, and the other look and feels are called auxiliary. For further information, see Using the Multiplexing Look and Feel. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

			<method>
				<name>
					public UIDefaults getDefaults()
				</name>
				<description>

			<method>

					public static ComponentUI createUIs(ComponentUI mui,                      Vector uis,                      JComponent target)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates the ComponentUI objects required to present the target component, placing the objects in the uis vector and returning the ComponentUI object that best represents the component's UI. This method finds the ComponentUI objects by invoking getDefaults().getUI(target) on each default and auxiliary look and feel currently in use. The first UI object this method adds to the uis vector is for the default look and feel. This method is invoked by the createUI method of MultiXxxxUI classes.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected static ComponentUI[] uisToArray(Vector uis)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates an array, populates it with UI objects from the passed-in vector, and returns the array. If uis is null, this method returns an array with zero elements. If uis is an empty vector, this method returns null. A run-time error occurs if any objects in the uis vector are not of type ComponentUI.
