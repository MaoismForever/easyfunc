			public final class NO_IMPLEMENT  extends SystemException
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception indicates that even though the operation that was invoked exists (it has an IDL definition), no implementation for that operation exists. NO_IMPLEMENT can, for example, be raised by an ORB if a client asks for an object's type definition from the interface repository, but no interface repository is provided by the ORB. It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status. It may also contain a string describing the exception. See the section Minor Code Meanings to see the minor codes for this exception.
