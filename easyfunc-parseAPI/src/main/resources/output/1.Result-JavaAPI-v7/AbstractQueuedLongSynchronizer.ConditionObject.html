			public class AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.ConditionObject  extends Object  implements Condition, Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			Condition implementation for a AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer serving as the basis of a Lock implementation. Method documentation for this class describes mechanics, not behavioral specifications from the point of view of Lock and Condition users. Exported versions of this class will in general need to be accompanied by documentation describing condition semantics that rely on those of the associated AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer. This class is Serializable, but all fields are transient, so deserialized conditions have no waiters.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.ConditionObject()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a new ConditionObject instance.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final void signal()
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves the longest-waiting thread, if one exists, from the wait queue for this condition to the wait queue for the owning lock.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final void signalAll()
				</name>
				<description>
					Moves all threads from the wait queue for this condition to the wait queue for the owning lock.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final void awaitUninterruptibly()
				</name>
				<description>
					Implements uninterruptible condition wait. Save lock state returned by AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.getState(). Invoke AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.release(long) with saved state as argument, throwing IllegalMonitorStateException if it fails. Block until signalled. Reacquire by invoking specialized version of AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.acquire(long) with saved state as argument.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final void await()                   throws InterruptedException
				</name>
				<description>
					Implements interruptible condition wait. If current thread is interrupted, throw InterruptedException. Save lock state returned by AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.getState(). Invoke AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.release(long) with saved state as argument, throwing IllegalMonitorStateException if it fails. Block until signalled or interrupted. Reacquire by invoking specialized version of AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.acquire(long) with saved state as argument. If interrupted while blocked in step 4, throw InterruptedException.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final long awaitNanos(long nanosTimeout)                        throws InterruptedException
				</name>
				<description>
					Implements timed condition wait. If current thread is interrupted, throw InterruptedException. Save lock state returned by AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.getState(). Invoke AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.release(long) with saved state as argument, throwing IllegalMonitorStateException if it fails. Block until signalled, interrupted, or timed out. Reacquire by invoking specialized version of AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.acquire(long) with saved state as argument. If interrupted while blocked in step 4, throw InterruptedException.

				<name>
					public final boolean awaitUntil(Date deadline)                           throws InterruptedException
				</name>
				<description>
					Implements absolute timed condition wait. If current thread is interrupted, throw InterruptedException. Save lock state returned by AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.getState(). Invoke AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.release(long) with saved state as argument, throwing IllegalMonitorStateException if it fails. Block until signalled, interrupted, or timed out. Reacquire by invoking specialized version of AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.acquire(long) with saved state as argument. If interrupted while blocked in step 4, throw InterruptedException. If timed out while blocked in step 4, return false, else true.

				<description>
					Implements timed condition wait. If current thread is interrupted, throw InterruptedException. Save lock state returned by AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.getState(). Invoke AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.release(long) with saved state as argument, throwing IllegalMonitorStateException if it fails. Block until signalled, interrupted, or timed out. Reacquire by invoking specialized version of AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.acquire(long) with saved state as argument. If interrupted while blocked in step 4, throw InterruptedException. If timed out while blocked in step 4, return false, else true.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected final boolean hasWaiters()
				</name>
				<description>
					Queries whether any threads are waiting on this condition. Implements AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.hasWaiters(java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.ConditionObject).
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					protected final int getWaitQueueLength()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on this condition. Implements AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.getWaitQueueLength(java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer.ConditionObject).

			<method>
				<name>
					protected final Collection<Thread> getWaitingThreads()
