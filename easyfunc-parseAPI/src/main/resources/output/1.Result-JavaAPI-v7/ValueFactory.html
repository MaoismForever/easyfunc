		<description>
			The ValueFactory interface is the native mapping for the IDL type CORBA::ValueFactory. The read_value() method is called by the ORB runtime while in the process of unmarshaling a value type. A user shall implement this method as part of implementing a type specific value factory. In the implementation, the user shall call is.read_value(java.io.Serializable) with a uninitialized valuetype to use for unmarshaling. The value returned by the stream is the same value passed in, with all the data unmarshaled.
