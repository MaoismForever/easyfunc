		<description>
			An interface that must be implemented by a component that wants to be notified when a significant event happens in the life of a RowSet object. A component becomes a listener by being registered with a RowSet object via the method RowSet.addRowSetListener. How a registered component implements this interface determines what it does when it is notified of an event.
