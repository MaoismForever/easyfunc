		<description>
			A CompletionService that uses a supplied Executor to execute tasks. This class arranges that submitted tasks are, upon completion, placed on a queue accessible using take. The class is lightweight enough to be suitable for transient use when processing groups of tasks. Usage Examples. Suppose you have a set of solvers for a certain problem, each returning a value of some type Result, and would like to run them concurrently, processing the results of each of them that return a non-null value, in some method use(Result r). You could write this as:  void solve(Executor e,              Collection<Callable<Result>> solvers)       throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {       CompletionService<Result> ecs           = new ExecutorCompletionService<Result>(e);       for (Callable<Result> s : solvers)           ecs.submit(s);       int n = solvers.size();       for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {           Result r = ecs.take().get();           if (r != null)               use(r);       }   } Suppose instead that you would like to use the first non-null result of the set of tasks, ignoring any that encounter exceptions, and cancelling all other tasks when the first one is ready:  void solve(Executor e,              Collection<Callable<Result>> solvers)       throws InterruptedException {       CompletionService<Result> ecs           = new ExecutorCompletionService<Result>(e);       int n = solvers.size();       List<Future<Result>> futures           = new ArrayList<Future<Result>>(n);       Result result = null;       try {           for (Callable<Result> s : solvers)               futures.add(ecs.submit(s));           for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {               try {                   Result r = ecs.take().get();                   if (r != null) {                       result = r;                       break;                   }               } catch (ExecutionException ignore) {}           }       }       finally {           for (Future<Result> f : futures)               f.cancel(true);       }         if (result != null)           use(result);   }
