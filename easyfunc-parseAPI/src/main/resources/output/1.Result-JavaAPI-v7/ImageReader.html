			public abstract class ImageReader  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			An abstract superclass for parsing and decoding of images. This class must be subclassed by classes that read in images in the context of the Java Image I/O framework. ImageReader objects are normally instantiated by the service provider interface (SPI) class for the specific format. Service provider classes (e.g., instances of ImageReaderSpi) are registered with the IIORegistry, which uses them for format recognition and presentation of available format readers and writers. When an input source is set (using the setInput method), it may be marked as "seek forward only". This setting means that images contained within the input source will only be read in order, possibly allowing the reader to avoid caching portions of the input containing data associated with images that have been read previously.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an ImageReader and sets its originatingProvider field to the supplied value. Subclasses that make use of extensions should provide a constructor with signature (ImageReaderSpi, Object) in order to retrieve the extension object. If the extension object is unsuitable, an IllegalArgumentException should be thrown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getFormatName()                       throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a String identifying the format of the input source. The default implementation returns originatingProvider.getFormatNames()[0]. Implementations that may not have an originating service provider, or which desire a different naming policy should override this method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ImageReaderSpi getOriginatingProvider()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the ImageReaderSpi that was passed in on the constructor. Note that this value may be null.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setInput(Object input,              boolean seekForwardOnly,              boolean ignoreMetadata)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the input source to use to the given ImageInputStream or other Object. The input source must be set before any of the query or read methods are used. If input is null, any currently set input source will be removed. In any case, the value of minIndex will be initialized to 0. The seekForwardOnly parameter controls whether the value returned by getMinIndex will be increased as each image (or thumbnail, or image metadata) is read. If seekForwardOnly is true, then a call to read(index) will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException if index < this.minIndex; otherwise, the value of minIndex will be set to index. If seekForwardOnly is false, the value of minIndex will remain 0 regardless of any read operations. The ignoreMetadata parameter, if set to true, allows the reader to disregard any metadata encountered during the read. Subsequent calls to the getStreamMetadata and getImageMetadata methods may return null, and an IIOImage returned from readAll may return null from their getMetadata method. Setting this parameter may allow the reader to work more efficiently. The reader may choose to disregard this setting and return metadata normally. Subclasses should take care to remove any cached information based on the previous stream, such as header information or partially decoded image data. Use of a general Object other than an ImageInputStream is intended for readers that interact directly with a capture device or imaging protocol. The set of legal classes is advertised by the reader's service provider's getInputTypes method; most readers will return a single-element array containing only ImageInputStream.class to indicate that they accept only an ImageInputStream. The default implementation checks the input argument against the list returned by originatingProvider.getInputTypes() and fails if the argument is not an instance of one of the classes in the list. If the originating provider is set to null, the input is accepted only if it is an ImageInputStream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setInput(Object input,              boolean seekForwardOnly)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the input source to use to the given ImageInputStream or other Object. The input source must be set before any of the query or read methods are used. If input is null, any currently set input source will be removed. In any case, the value of minIndex will be initialized to 0. The seekForwardOnly parameter controls whether the value returned by getMinIndex will be increased as each image (or thumbnail, or image metadata) is read. If seekForwardOnly is true, then a call to read(index) will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException if index < this.minIndex; otherwise, the value of minIndex will be set to index. If seekForwardOnly is false, the value of minIndex will remain 0 regardless of any read operations. This method is equivalent to setInput(input, seekForwardOnly, false).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setInput(Object input)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the input source to use to the given ImageInputStream or other Object. The input source must be set before any of the query or read methods are used. If input is null, any currently set input source will be removed. In any case, the value of minIndex will be initialized to 0. This method is equivalent to setInput(input, false, false).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object getInput()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the ImageInputStream or other Object previously set as the input source. If the input source has not been set, null is returned.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isSeekForwardOnly()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the current input source has been marked as seek forward only by passing true as the seekForwardOnly argument to the setInput method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isIgnoringMetadata()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the current input source has been marked as allowing metadata to be ignored by passing true as the ignoreMetadata argument to the setInput method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getMinIndex()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the lowest valid index for reading an image, thumbnail, or image metadata. If seekForwardOnly() is false, this value will typically remain 0, indicating that random access is possible. Otherwise, it will contain the value of the most recently accessed index, and increase in a monotonic fashion.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Locale[] getAvailableLocales()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of Locales that may be used to localize warning listeners and compression settings. A return value of null indicates that localization is not supported. The default implementation returns a clone of the availableLocales instance variable if it is non-null, or else returns null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setLocale(Locale locale)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the current Locale of this ImageReader to the given value. A value of null removes any previous setting, and indicates that the reader should localize as it sees fit.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Locale getLocale()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the currently set Locale, or null if none has been set.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract int getNumImages(boolean allowSearch)                            throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of images, not including thumbnails, available from the current input source. Note that some image formats (such as animated GIF) do not specify how many images are present in the stream. Thus determining the number of images will require the entire stream to be scanned and may require memory for buffering. If images are to be processed in order, it may be more efficient to simply call read with increasing indices until an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown to indicate that no more images are available. The allowSearch parameter may be set to false to indicate that an exhaustive search is not desired; the return value will be -1 to indicate that a search is necessary. If the input has been specified with seekForwardOnly set to true, this method throws an IllegalStateException if allowSearch is set to true.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract int getWidth(int imageIndex)                        throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the width in pixels of the given image within the input source. If the image can be rendered to a user-specified size, then this method returns the default width.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract int getHeight(int imageIndex)                         throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the height in pixels of the given image within the input source. If the image can be rendered to a user-specified size, then this method returns the default height.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isRandomAccessEasy(int imageIndex)                             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the storage format of the given image places no inherent impediment on random access to pixels. For most compressed formats, such as JPEG, this method should return false, as a large section of the image in addition to the region of interest may need to be decoded. This is merely a hint for programs that wish to be efficient; all readers must be able to read arbitrary regions as specified in an ImageReadParam. Note that formats that return false from this method may nonetheless allow tiling (e.g. Restart Markers in JPEG), and random access will likely be reasonably efficient on tiles. See isImageTiled. A reader for which all images are guaranteed to support easy random access, or are guaranteed not to support easy random access, may return true or false respectively without accessing any image data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an exception even if no input source has been set or the image index is out of bounds. The default implementation returns false.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public float getAspectRatio(int imageIndex)                       throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the aspect ratio of the given image (that is, its width divided by its height) as a float. For images that are inherently resizable, this method provides a way to determine the appropriate width given a deired height, or vice versa. For non-resizable images, the true width and height are used. The default implementation simply returns (float)getWidth(imageIndex)/getHeight(imageIndex).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ImageTypeSpecifier getRawImageType(int imageIndex)                                     throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an ImageTypeSpecifier indicating the SampleModel and ColorModel which most closely represents the "raw" internal format of the image. For example, for a JPEG image the raw type might have a YCbCr color space even though the image would conventionally be transformed into an RGB color space prior to display. The returned value should also be included in the list of values returned by getImageTypes. The default implementation simply returns the first entry from the list provided by getImageType.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract Iterator<ImageTypeSpecifier> getImageTypes(int imageIndex)                                                      throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an Iterator containing possible image types to which the given image may be decoded, in the form of ImageTypeSpecifierss. At least one legal image type will be returned. The first element of the iterator should be the most "natural" type for decoding the image with as little loss as possible. For example, for a JPEG image the first entry should be an RGB image, even though the image data is stored internally in a YCbCr color space.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ImageReadParam getDefaultReadParam()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a default ImageReadParam object appropriate for this format. All subclasses should define a set of default values for all parameters and return them with this call. This method may be called before the input source is set. The default implementation constructs and returns a new ImageReadParam object that does not allow source scaling (i.e., it returns new ImageReadParam().
				</description>

				<name>
					public abstract IIOMetadata getStreamMetadata()                                         throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an IIOMetadata object representing the metadata associated with the input source as a whole (i.e., not associated with any particular image), or null if the reader does not support reading metadata, is set to ignore metadata, or if no metadata is available.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public IIOMetadata getStreamMetadata(String formatName,                              Set<String> nodeNames)                                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an IIOMetadata object representing the metadata associated with the input source as a whole (i.e., not associated with any particular image). If no such data exists, null is returned. The resuting metadata object is only responsible for returning documents in the format named by formatName. Within any documents that are returned, only nodes whose names are members of nodeNames are required to be returned. In this way, the amount of metadata processing done by the reader may be kept to a minimum, based on what information is actually needed. If formatName is not the name of a supported metadata format, null is returned. In all cases, it is legal to return a more capable metadata object than strictly necessary. The format name and node names are merely hints that may be used to reduce the reader's workload. The default implementation simply returns the result of calling getStreamMetadata(), after checking that the format name is supported. If it is not, null is returned.

					public abstract IIOMetadata getImageMetadata(int imageIndex)                                        throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an IIOMetadata object containing metadata associated with the given image, or null if the reader does not support reading metadata, is set to ignore metadata, or if no metadata is available.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public IIOMetadata getImageMetadata(int imageIndex,                             String formatName,                             Set<String> nodeNames)                               throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an IIOMetadata object representing the metadata associated with the given image, or null if the reader does not support reading metadata or none is available. The resuting metadata object is only responsible for returning documents in the format named by formatName. Within any documents that are returned, only nodes whose names are members of nodeNames are required to be returned. In this way, the amount of metadata processing done by the reader may be kept to a minimum, based on what information is actually needed. If formatName is not the name of a supported metadata format, null may be returned. In all cases, it is legal to return a more capable metadata object than strictly necessary. The format name and node names are merely hints that may be used to reduce the reader's workload. The default implementation simply returns the result of calling getImageMetadata(imageIndex), after checking that the format name is supported. If it is not, null is returned.

			<method>
				<name>
					public BufferedImage read(int imageIndex)                     throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads the image indexed by imageIndex and returns it as a complete BufferedImage, using a default ImageReadParam. This is a convenience method that calls read(imageIndex, null). The image returned will be formatted according to the first ImageTypeSpecifier returned from getImageTypes. Any registered IIOReadProgressListener objects will be notified by calling their imageStarted method, followed by calls to their imageProgress method as the read progresses. Finally their imageComplete method will be called. IIOReadUpdateListener objects may be updated at other times during the read as pixels are decoded. Finally, IIOReadWarningListener objects will receive notification of any non-fatal warnings that occur during decoding.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract BufferedImage read(int imageIndex,                   ImageReadParam param)                              throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads the image indexed by imageIndex and returns it as a complete BufferedImage, using a supplied ImageReadParam. The actual BufferedImage returned will be chosen using the algorithm defined by the getDestination method. Any registered IIOReadProgressListener objects will be notified by calling their imageStarted method, followed by calls to their imageProgress method as the read progresses. Finally their imageComplete method will be called. IIOReadUpdateListener objects may be updated at other times during the read as pixels are decoded. Finally, IIOReadWarningListener objects will receive notification of any non-fatal warnings that occur during decoding. The set of source bands to be read and destination bands to be written is determined by calling getSourceBands and getDestinationBands on the supplied ImageReadParam. If the lengths of the arrays returned by these methods differ, the set of source bands contains an index larger that the largest available source index, or the set of destination bands contains an index larger than the largest legal destination index, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. If the supplied ImageReadParam contains optional setting values not supported by this reader (e.g. source render size or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public IIOImage readAll(int imageIndex,                 ImageReadParam param)                   throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads the image indexed by imageIndex and returns an IIOImage containing the image, thumbnails, and associated image metadata, using a supplied ImageReadParam. The actual BufferedImage referenced by the returned IIOImage will be chosen using the algorithm defined by the getDestination method. Any registered IIOReadProgressListener objects will be notified by calling their imageStarted method, followed by calls to their imageProgress method as the read progresses. Finally their imageComplete method will be called. IIOReadUpdateListener objects may be updated at other times during the read as pixels are decoded. Finally, IIOReadWarningListener objects will receive notification of any non-fatal warnings that occur during decoding. The set of source bands to be read and destination bands to be written is determined by calling getSourceBands and getDestinationBands on the supplied ImageReadParam. If the lengths of the arrays returned by these methods differ, the set of source bands contains an index larger that the largest available source index, or the set of destination bands contains an index larger than the largest legal destination index, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. Thumbnails will be returned in their entirety regardless of the region settings. If the supplied ImageReadParam contains optional setting values not supported by this reader (e.g. source render size or any format-specific settings), those values will be ignored.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public Iterator<IIOImage> readAll(Iterator<? extends ImageReadParam> params)                             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an Iterator containing all the images, thumbnails, and metadata, starting at the index given by getMinIndex, from the input source in the form of IIOImage objects. An Iterator containing ImageReadParam objects is supplied; one element is consumed for each image read from the input source until no more images are available. If the read param Iterator runs out of elements, but there are still more images available from the input source, default read params are used for the remaining images. If params is null, a default read param will be used for all images. The actual BufferedImage referenced by the returned IIOImage will be chosen using the algorithm defined by the getDestination method. Any registered IIOReadProgressListener objects will be notified by calling their sequenceStarted method once. Then, for each image decoded, there will be a call to imageStarted, followed by calls to imageProgress as the read progresses, and finally to imageComplete. The sequenceComplete method will be called after the last image has been decoded. IIOReadUpdateListener objects may be updated at other times during the read as pixels are decoded. Finally, IIOReadWarningListener objects will receive notification of any non-fatal warnings that occur during decoding. The set of source bands to be read and destination bands to be written is determined by calling getSourceBands and getDestinationBands on the supplied ImageReadParam. If the lengths of the arrays returned by these methods differ, the set of source bands contains an index larger that the largest available source index, or the set of destination bands contains an index larger than the largest legal destination index, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. Thumbnails will be returned in their entirety regardless of the region settings. If any of the supplied ImageReadParams contain optional setting values not supported by this reader (e.g. source render size or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean canReadRaster()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this plug-in supports reading just a Raster of pixel data. If this method returns false, calls to readRaster or readTileRaster will throw an UnsupportedOperationException. The default implementation returns false.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Raster readRaster(int imageIndex,                  ImageReadParam param)                    throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a new Raster object containing the raw pixel data from the image stream, without any color conversion applied. The application must determine how to interpret the pixel data by other means. Any destination or image-type parameters in the supplied ImageReadParam object are ignored, but all other parameters are used exactly as in the read method, except that any destination offset is used as a logical rather than a physical offset. The size of the returned Raster will always be that of the source region clipped to the actual image. Logical offsets in the stream itself are ignored. This method allows formats that normally apply a color conversion, such as JPEG, and formats that do not normally have an associated colorspace, such as remote sensing or medical imaging data, to provide access to raw pixel data. Any registered readUpdateListeners are ignored, as there is no BufferedImage, but all other listeners are called exactly as they are for the read method. If canReadRaster() returns false, this method throws an UnsupportedOperationException. If the supplied ImageReadParam contains optional setting values not supported by this reader (e.g. source render size or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored. The default implementation throws an UnsupportedOperationException.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isImageTiled(int imageIndex)                       throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the image is organized into tiles, that is, equal-sized non-overlapping rectangles. A reader plug-in may choose whether or not to expose tiling that is present in the image as it is stored. It may even choose to advertise tiling when none is explicitly present. In general, tiling should only be advertised if there is some advantage (in speed or space) to accessing individual tiles. Regardless of whether the reader advertises tiling, it must be capable of reading an arbitrary rectangular region specified in an ImageReadParam. A reader for which all images are guaranteed to be tiled, or are guaranteed not to be tiled, may return true or false respectively without accessing any image data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an exception even if no input source has been set or the image index is out of bounds. The default implementation just returns false.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getTileWidth(int imageIndex)                   throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the width of a tile in the given image. The default implementation simply returns getWidth(imageIndex), which is correct for non-tiled images. Readers that support tiling should override this method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getTileHeight(int imageIndex)                    throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the height of a tile in the given image. The default implementation simply returns getHeight(imageIndex), which is correct for non-tiled images. Readers that support tiling should override this method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getTileGridXOffset(int imageIndex)                         throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the X coordinate of the upper-left corner of tile (0, 0) in the given image. A reader for which the tile grid X offset always has the same value (usually 0), may return the value without accessing any image data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an exception even if no input source has been set or the image index is out of bounds. The default implementation simply returns 0, which is correct for non-tiled images and tiled images in most formats. Readers that support tiling with non-(0, 0) offsets should override this method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getTileGridYOffset(int imageIndex)                         throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the Y coordinate of the upper-left corner of tile (0, 0) in the given image. A reader for which the tile grid Y offset always has the same value (usually 0), may return the value without accessing any image data. In such cases, it is not necessary to throw an exception even if no input source has been set or the image index is out of bounds. The default implementation simply returns 0, which is correct for non-tiled images and tiled images in most formats. Readers that support tiling with non-(0, 0) offsets should override this method.

				</name>
				<description>
					Reads the tile indicated by the tileX and tileY arguments, returning it as a BufferedImage. If the arguments are out of range, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. If the image is not tiled, the values 0, 0 will return the entire image; any other values will cause an IllegalArgumentException to be thrown. This method is merely a convenience equivalent to calling read(int, ImageReadParam) with a read param specifiying a source region having offsets of tileX*getTileWidth(imageIndex), tileY*getTileHeight(imageIndex) and width and height of getTileWidth(imageIndex), getTileHeight(imageIndex); and subsampling factors of 1 and offsets of 0. To subsample a tile, call read with a read param specifying this region and different subsampling parameters. The default implementation returns the entire image if tileX and tileY are 0, or throws an IllegalArgumentException otherwise.

				<description>
					Returns a new Raster object containing the raw pixel data from the tile, without any color conversion applied. The application must determine how to interpret the pixel data by other means. If canReadRaster() returns false, this method throws an UnsupportedOperationException. The default implementation checks if reading Rasters is supported, and if so calls readRaster(imageIndex, null) if tileX and tileY are 0, or throws an IllegalArgumentException otherwise.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a RenderedImage object that contains the contents of the image indexed by imageIndex. By default, the returned image is simply the BufferedImage returned by read(imageIndex, param). The semantics of this method may differ from those of the other read methods in several ways. First, any destination image and/or image type set in the ImageReadParam may be ignored. Second, the usual listener calls are not guaranteed to be made, or to be meaningful if they are. This is because the returned image may not be fully populated with pixel data at the time it is returned, or indeed at any time. If the supplied ImageReadParam contains optional setting values not supported by this reader (e.g. source render size or any format-specific settings), they will be ignored. The default implementation just calls read(imageIndex, param).

				</name>
				<description>
					Adds an IIOReadUpdateListener to the list of registered update listeners. If listener is null, no exception will be thrown and no action will be taken. The listener will receive notification of pixel updates as images and thumbnails are decoded, including the starts and ends of progressive passes. If no update listeners are present, the reader may choose to perform fewer updates to the pixels of the destination images and/or thumbnails, which may result in more efficient decoding. For example, in progressive JPEG decoding each pass contains updates to a set of coefficients, which would have to be transformed into pixel values and converted to an RGB color space for each pass if listeners are present. If no listeners are present, the coefficients may simply be accumulated and the final results transformed and color converted one time only. The final results of decoding will be the same whether or not intermediate updates are performed. Thus if only the final image is desired it may be perferable not to register any IIOReadUpdateListeners. In general, progressive updating is most effective when fetching images over a network connection that is very slow compared to local CPU processing; over a fast connection, progressive updates may actually slow down the presentation of the image.

				<description>
					Computes the source region of interest and the destination region of interest, taking the width and height of the source image, an optional destination image, and an optional ImageReadParam into account. The source region begins with the entire source image. Then that is clipped to the source region specified in the ImageReadParam, if one is specified. If either of the destination offsets are negative, the source region is clipped so that its top left will coincide with the top left of the destination image, taking subsampling into account. Then the result is clipped to the destination image on the right and bottom, if one is specified, taking subsampling and destination offsets into account. Similarly, the destination region begins with the source image, is translated to the destination offset given in the ImageReadParam if there is one, and finally is clipped to the destination image, if there is one. If either the source or destination regions end up having a width or height of 0, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. The getSourceRegion method may be used if only source clipping is desired.

				</name>
				<description>
					A utility method that may be used by readers to test the validity of the source and destination band settings of an ImageReadParam. This method may be called as soon as the reader knows both the number of bands of the source image as it exists in the input stream, and the number of bands of the destination image that being written. The method retrieves the source and destination band setting arrays from param using the getSourceBands and getDestinationBandsmethods (or considers them to be null if param is null). If the source band setting array is null, it is considered to be equal to the array { 0, 1, ..., numSrcBands - 1 }, and similarly for the destination band setting array. The method then tests that both arrays are equal in length, and that neither array contains a value larger than the largest available band index. Any failure results in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown; success results in the method returning silently.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the BufferedImage to which decoded pixel data should be written. The image is determined by inspecting the supplied ImageReadParam if it is non-null; if its getDestination method returns a non-null value, that image is simply returned. Otherwise, param.getDestinationType method is called to determine if a particular image type has been specified. If so, the returned ImageTypeSpecifier is used after checking that it is equal to one of those included in imageTypes. If param is null or the above steps have not yielded an image or an ImageTypeSpecifier, the first value obtained from the imageTypes parameter is used. Typically, the caller will set imageTypes to the value of getImageTypes(imageIndex). Next, the dimensions of the image are determined by a call to computeRegions. The actual width and height of the image being decoded are passed in as the width and height parameters.
