					Description copied from class: BasicEditorPaneUI Installs the UI for a component. This does the following things. Sets the associated component to opaque if the opaque property has not already been set by the client program. This will cause the component's background color to be painted. Installs the default caret and highlighter into the associated component. These properties are only set if their current value is either null or an instance of UIResource. Attaches to the editor and model. If there is no model, a default one is created. Creates the view factory and the view hierarchy used to represent the model.
