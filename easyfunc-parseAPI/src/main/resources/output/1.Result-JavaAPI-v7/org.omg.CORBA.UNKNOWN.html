			public final class UNKNOWN  extends SystemException
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception is raised if an operation implementation throws a non-CORBA exception (such as an exception specific to the implementation's programming language), or if an operation raises a user exception that does not appear in the operation's raises expression. UNKNOWN is also raised if the server returns a system exception that is unknown to the client. (This can happen if the server uses a later version of CORBA than the client and new system exceptions have been added to the later version.) It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status. It may also contain a string describing the exception. See the section Minor Code Meanings to see the minor codes for this exception.
