		<description>
			JLayer is a universal decorator for Swing components which enables you to implement various advanced painting effects as well as receive notifications of all AWTEvents generated within its borders. JLayer delegates the handling of painting and input events to a LayerUI object, which performs the actual decoration. The custom painting implemented in the LayerUI and events notification work for the JLayer itself and all its subcomponents. This combination enables you to enrich existing components by adding new advanced functionality such as temporary locking of a hierarchy, data tips for compound components, enhanced mouse scrolling etc and so on. JLayer is a good solution if you only need to do custom painting over compound component or catch input events from its subcomponents.    import javax.swing.*;   import javax.swing.plaf.LayerUI;   import java.awt.*;     public class JLayerSample {         private static JLayer<JComponent> createLayer() {           // This custom layerUI will fill the layer with translucent green           // and print out all mouseMotion events generated within its borders           LayerUI<JComponent> layerUI = new LayerUI<JComponent>() {                 public void paint(Graphics g, JComponent c) {                   // paint the layer as is                   super.paint(g, c);                   // fill it with the translucent green                   g.setColor(new Color(0, 128, 0, 128));                   g.fillRect(0, 0, c.getWidth(), c.getHeight());               }                 public void installUI(JComponent c) {                   super.installUI(c);                   // enable mouse motion events for the layer's subcomponents                   ((JLayer) c).setLayerEventMask(AWTEvent.MOUSE_MOTION_EVENT_MASK);               }                 public void uninstallUI(JComponent c) {                   super.uninstallUI(c);                   // reset the layer event mask                   ((JLayer) c).setLayerEventMask(0);               }                 // overridden method which catches MouseMotion events               public void eventDispatched(AWTEvent e, JLayer<? extends JComponent> l) {                   System.out.println("AWTEvent detected: " + e);               }           };           // create a component to be decorated with the layer           JPanel panel = new JPanel();           panel.add(new JButton("JButton"));             // create the layer for the panel using our custom layerUI           return new JLayer<JComponent>(panel, layerUI);       }         private static void createAndShowGUI() {           final JFrame frame = new JFrame();           frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);             // work with the layer as with any other Swing component           frame.add(createLayer());             frame.setSize(200, 200);           frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);           frame.setVisible(true);       }         public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {           SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(new Runnable() {               public void run() {                   createAndShowGUI();               }           });       }   }   Note: JLayer doesn't support the following methods: Container.add(java.awt.Component) Container.add(String, java.awt.Component) Container.add(java.awt.Component, int) Container.add(java.awt.Component, Object) Container.add(java.awt.Component, Object, int) using any of of them will cause UnsupportedOperationException to be thrown, to add a component to JLayer use setView(Component) or setGlassPane(JPanel).

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isOptimizedDrawingEnabled()
				</name>

					public void setLayerEventMask(long layerEventMask)
				</name>
				<description>
					Enables the events from JLayer and all its descendants defined by the specified event mask parameter to be delivered to the LayerUI.eventDispatched(AWTEvent, JLayer) method. Events are delivered provided that LayerUI is set for this JLayer and the JLayer is displayable. The following example shows how to correctly use this method in the LayerUI implementations:       public void installUI(JComponent c) {         super.installUI(c);         JLayer l = (JLayer) c;         // this LayerUI will receive only key and focus events         l.setLayerEventMask(AWTEvent.KEY_EVENT_MASK | AWTEvent.FOCUS_EVENT_MASK);      }        public void uninstallUI(JComponent c) {         super.uninstallUI(c);         JLayer l = (JLayer) c;         // JLayer must be returned to its initial state         l.setLayerEventMask(0);      }   By default JLayer receives no events and its event mask is 0.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public long getLayerEventMask()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the bitmap of event mask to receive by this JLayer and its LayerUI. It means that LayerUI.eventDispatched(AWTEvent, JLayer) method will only receive events that match the event mask. By default JLayer receives no events.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void updateUI()
				</name>
				<description>
					Delegates its functionality to the LayerUI.updateUI(JLayer) method, if LayerUI is set.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Dimension getPreferredScrollableViewportSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the preferred size of the viewport for a view component. If the view component of this layer implements Scrollable, this method delegates its implementation to the view component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getScrollableBlockIncrement(Rectangle visibleRect,                                int orientation,                                int direction)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a scroll increment, which is required for components that display logical rows or columns in order to completely expose one block of rows or columns, depending on the value of orientation. If the view component of this layer implements Scrollable, this method delegates its implementation to the view component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportHeight()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns false to indicate that the height of the viewport does not determine the height of the layer, unless the preferred height of the layer is smaller than the height of the viewport. If the view component of this layer implements Scrollable, this method delegates its implementation to the view component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportWidth()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns false to indicate that the width of the viewport does not determine the width of the layer, unless the preferred width of the layer is smaller than the width of the viewport. If the view component of this layer implements Scrollable, this method delegates its implementation to the view component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getScrollableUnitIncrement(Rectangle visibleRect,                               int orientation,                               int direction)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a scroll increment, which is required for components that display logical rows or columns in order to completely expose one new row or column, depending on the value of orientation. Ideally, components should handle a partially exposed row or column by returning the distance required to completely expose the item. Scrolling containers, like JScrollPane, will use this method each time the user requests a unit scroll. If the view component of this layer implements Scrollable, this method delegates its implementation to the view component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void addNotify()
				</name>
				<description>
					Notifies this component that it now has a parent component. When this method is invoked, the chain of parent components is set up with KeyboardAction event listeners. This method is called by the toolkit internally and should not be called directly by programs.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void removeNotify()
				</name>
				<description>
					Notifies this component that it no longer has a parent component. When this method is invoked, any KeyboardActions set up in the the chain of parent components are removed. This method is called by the toolkit internally and should not be called directly by programs.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void doLayout()
				</name>
				<description>
					Delegates its functionality to the LayerUI.doLayout(JLayer) method, if LayerUI is set.
