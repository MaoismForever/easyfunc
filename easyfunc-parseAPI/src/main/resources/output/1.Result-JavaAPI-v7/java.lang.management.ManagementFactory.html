		<description>
			The ManagementFactory class is a factory class for getting managed beans for the Java platform. This class consists of static methods each of which returns one or more platform MXBeans representing the management interface of a component of the Java virtual machine. Platform MXBeans A platform MXBean is a managed bean that conforms to the JMX Instrumentation Specification and only uses a set of basic data types. A JMX management application and the platform MBeanServer can interoperate without requiring classes for MXBean specific data types. The data types being transmitted between the JMX connector server and the connector client are open types and this allows interoperation across versions. See the specification of MXBeans for details. Each platform MXBean is a PlatformManagedObject and it has a unique ObjectName for registration in the platform MBeanServer as returned by by the getObjectName method. An application can access a platform MXBean in the following ways: 1. Direct access to an MXBean interface Get an MXBean instance by calling the getPlatformMXBean or getPlatformMXBeans method and access the MXBean locally in the running virtual machine. Construct an MXBean proxy instance that forwards the method calls to a given MBeanServer by calling the getPlatformMXBean(MBeanServerConnection, Class) or getPlatformMXBeans(MBeanServerConnection, Class) method. The newPlatformMXBeanProxy method can also be used to construct an MXBean proxy instance of a given ObjectName. A proxy is typically constructed to remotely access an MXBean of another running virtual machine. 2. Indirect access to an MXBean interface via MBeanServer Go through the platform MBeanServer to access MXBeans locally or a specific MBeanServerConnection to access MXBeans remotely. The attributes and operations of an MXBean use only JMX open types which include basic data types, CompositeData, and TabularData defined in OpenType. The mapping is specified in the MXBean specification for details. The getPlatformManagementInterfaces method returns all management interfaces supported in the Java virtual machine including the standard management interfaces listed in the tables below as well as the management interfaces extended by the JDK implementation. A Java virtual machine has a single instance of the following management interfaces: Management Interface ObjectName ClassLoadingMXBean java.lang:type=ClassLoading MemoryMXBean java.lang:type=Memory ThreadMXBean java.lang:type=Threading RuntimeMXBean java.lang:type=Runtime OperatingSystemMXBean java.lang:type=OperatingSystem PlatformLoggingMXBean java.util.logging:type=Logging A Java virtual machine has zero or a single instance of the following management interfaces. Management Interface ObjectName CompilationMXBean java.lang:type=Compilation A Java virtual machine may have one or more instances of the following management interfaces. Management Interface ObjectName GarbageCollectorMXBean java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,name=collector's name MemoryManagerMXBean java.lang:type=MemoryManager,name=manager's name MemoryPoolMXBean java.lang:type=MemoryPool,name=pool's name BufferPoolMXBean java.nio:type=BufferPool,name=pool name

			<method>
				<name>
					public static MBeanServer getPlatformMBeanServer()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the platform MBeanServer. On the first call to this method, it first creates the platform MBeanServer by calling the MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer method and registers each platform MXBean in this platform MBeanServer with its ObjectName. This method, in subsequent calls, will simply return the initially created platform MBeanServer. MXBeans that get created and destroyed dynamically, for example, memory pools and managers, will automatically be registered and deregistered into the platform MBeanServer. If the system property javax.management.builder.initial is set, the platform MBeanServer creation will be done by the specified MBeanServerBuilder. It is recommended that this platform MBeanServer also be used to register other application managed beans besides the platform MXBeans. This will allow all MBeans to be published through the same MBeanServer and hence allow for easier network publishing and discovery. Name conflicts with the platform MXBeans should be avoided.

					public static <T> T newPlatformMXBeanProxy(MBeanServerConnection connection,                             String mxbeanName,                             Class<T> mxbeanInterface)                                  throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a proxy for a platform MXBean interface of a given MXBean name that forwards its method calls through the given MBeanServerConnection. This method is equivalent to: Proxy.newProxyInstance(mxbeanInterface.getClassLoader(), new Class[] { mxbeanInterface }, handler) where handler is an InvocationHandler to which method invocations to the MXBean interface are dispatched. This handler converts an input parameter from an MXBean data type to its mapped open type before forwarding to the MBeanServer and converts a return value from an MXBean method call through the MBeanServer from an open type to the corresponding return type declared in the MXBean interface. If the MXBean is a notification emitter (i.e., it implements NotificationEmitter), both the mxbeanInterface and NotificationEmitter will be implemented by this proxy. Notes: Using an MXBean proxy is a convenience remote access to a platform MXBean of a running virtual machine. All method calls to the MXBean proxy are forwarded to an MBeanServerConnection where IOException may be thrown when the communication problem occurs with the connector server. An application remotely accesses the platform MXBeans using proxy should prepare to catch IOException as if accessing with the MBeanServerConnector interface. When a client application is designed to remotely access MXBeans for a running virtual machine whose version is different than the version on which the application is running, it should prepare to catch InvalidObjectException which is thrown when an MXBean proxy receives a name of an enum constant which is missing in the enum class loaded in the client application. MBeanServerInvocationHandler or its newProxyInstance method cannot be used to create a proxy for a platform MXBean. The proxy object created by MBeanServerInvocationHandler does not handle the properties of the platform MXBeans described in the class specification.
