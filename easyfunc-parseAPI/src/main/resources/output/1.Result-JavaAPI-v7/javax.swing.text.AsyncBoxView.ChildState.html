			public class AsyncBoxView.ChildState  extends Object  implements Runnable
		</name>
		<description>
			A record representing the layout state of a child view. It is runnable as a task on another thread. All access to the child view that is based upon a read-lock on the model should synchronize on this object (i.e. The layout thread and the GUI thread can both have a read lock on the model at the same time and are not protected from each other). Access to a child view hierarchy is serialized via synchronization on the ChildState instance.

					public AsyncBoxView.ChildState(View v)

				<description>
					Construct a child status. This needs to start out as fairly large so we don't falsely begin with the idea that all of the children are visible.

					public View getChildView()
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetch the child view this record represents

					public void run()
				</name>
				<description>
					Update the child state. This should be called by the thread that desires to spend time updating the child state (intended to be the layout thread). This aquires a read lock on the associated document for the duration of the update to ensure the model is not changed while it is operating. The first thing to do would be to see if any work actually needs to be done. The following could have conceivably happened while the state was waiting to be updated: The child may have been removed from the view hierarchy. The child may have been updated by a higher priority operation (i.e. the child may have become visible).
