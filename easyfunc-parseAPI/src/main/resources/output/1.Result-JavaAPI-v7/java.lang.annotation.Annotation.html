			public interface Annotation
		</name>
		<description>
			The common interface extended by all annotation types. Note that an interface that manually extends this one does not define an annotation type. Also note that this interface does not itself define an annotation type. More information about annotation types can be found in section 9.6 of The Java™ Language Specification.

			<method>
				<name>
					boolean equals(Object obj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the specified object represents an annotation that is logically equivalent to this one. In other words, returns true if the specified object is an instance of the same annotation type as this instance, all of whose members are equal to the corresponding member of this annotation, as defined below: Two corresponding primitive typed members whose values are x and y are considered equal if x == y, unless their type is float or double. Two corresponding float members whose values are x and y are considered equal if Float.valueOf(x).equals(Float.valueOf(y)). (Unlike the == operator, NaN is considered equal to itself, and 0.0f unequal to -0.0f.) Two corresponding double members whose values are x and y are considered equal if Double.valueOf(x).equals(Double.valueOf(y)). (Unlike the == operator, NaN is considered equal to itself, and 0.0 unequal to -0.0.) Two corresponding String, Class, enum, or annotation typed members whose values are x and y are considered equal if x.equals(y). (Note that this definition is recursive for annotation typed members.) Two corresponding array typed members x and y are considered equal if Arrays.equals(x, y), for the appropriate overloading of Arrays.equals(long[], long[]).

			<method>
				<name>
					int hashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the hash code of this annotation, as defined below: The hash code of an annotation is the sum of the hash codes of its members (including those with default values), as defined below: The hash code of an annotation member is (127 times the hash code of the member-name as computed by String.hashCode()) XOR the hash code of the member-value, as defined below: The hash code of a member-value depends on its type: The hash code of a primitive value v is equal to WrapperType.valueOf(v).hashCode(), where WrapperType is the wrapper type corresponding to the primitive type of v (Byte, Character, Double, Float, Integer, Long, Short, or Boolean). The hash code of a string, enum, class, or annotation member-value I v is computed as by calling v.hashCode(). (In the case of annotation member values, this is a recursive definition.) The hash code of an array member-value is computed by calling the appropriate overloading of Arrays.hashCode on the value. (There is one overloading for each primitive type, and one for object reference types.)

			<method>
				<name>
					String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this annotation. The details of the representation are implementation-dependent, but the following may be regarded as typical:      @com.acme.util.Name(first=Alfred, middle=E., last=Neuman)
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Class<? extends Annotation> annotationType()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the annotation type of this annotation.
