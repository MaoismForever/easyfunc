			public class AttributeModificationException  extends NamingException
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception is thrown when an attempt is made to add, or remove, or modify an attribute, its identifier, or its values that conflicts with the attribute's (schema) definition or the attribute's state. It is thrown in response to DirContext.modifyAttributes(). It contains a list of modifications that have not been performed, in the order that they were supplied to modifyAttributes(). If the list is null, none of the modifications were performed successfully. An AttributeModificationException instance is not synchronized against concurrent multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a single AttributeModification instance should lock the object.
