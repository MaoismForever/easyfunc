			public class LinkException  extends NamingException
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception is used to describe problems encounter while resolving links. Addition information is added to the base NamingException for pinpointing the problem with the link. Analogous to how NamingException captures name resolution information, LinkException captures "link"-name resolution information pinpointing the problem encountered while resolving a link. All these fields may be null. Link Resolved Name. Portion of link name that has been resolved. Link Resolved Object. Object to which resolution of link name proceeded. Link Remaining Name. Portion of link name that has not been resolved. Link Explanation. Detail explaining why link resolution failed. A LinkException instance is not synchronized against concurrent multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a single LinkException instance should lock the object.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setLinkResolvedName(Name name)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the resolved link name field of this exception. name is a composite name. If the intent is to set this field using a compound name or string, you must "stringify" the compound name, and create a composite name with a single component using the string. You can then invoke this method using the resulting composite name. A copy of name is made and stored. Subsequent changes to name does not affect the copy in this NamingException and vice versa.

					Sets the remaining link name field of this exception. name is a composite name. If the intent is to set this field using a compound name or string, you must "stringify" the compound name, and create a composite name with a single component using the string.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Generates the string representation of this exception. This string consists of the NamingException information plus the link's remaining name. This string is used for debugging and not meant to be interpreted programmatically.

			<method>
				<name>
					public String toString(boolean detail)
				</name>
				<description>
					Generates the string representation of this exception. This string consists of the NamingException information plus the additional information of resolving the link. If 'detail' is true, the string also contains information on the link resolved object. If false, this method is the same as the form of toString() that accepts no parameters. This string is used for debugging and not meant to be interpreted programmatically.
