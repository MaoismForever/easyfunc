			public class ScrollPane  extends Container  implements Accessible
		</name>
		<description>
			A container class which implements automatic horizontal and/or vertical scrolling for a single child component. The display policy for the scrollbars can be set to: as needed: scrollbars created and shown only when needed by scrollpane always: scrollbars created and always shown by the scrollpane never: scrollbars never created or shown by the scrollpane The state of the horizontal and vertical scrollbars is represented by two ScrollPaneAdjustable objects (one for each dimension) which implement the Adjustable interface. The API provides methods to access those objects such that the attributes on the Adjustable object (such as unitIncrement, value, etc.) can be manipulated. Certain adjustable properties (minimum, maximum, blockIncrement, and visibleAmount) are set internally by the scrollpane in accordance with the geometry of the scrollpane and its child and these should not be set by programs using the scrollpane. If the scrollbar display policy is defined as "never", then the scrollpane can still be programmatically scrolled using the setScrollPosition() method and the scrollpane will move and clip the child's contents appropriately. This policy is useful if the program needs to create and manage its own adjustable controls. The placement of the scrollbars is controlled by platform-specific properties set by the user outside of the program. The initial size of this container is set to 100x100, but can be reset using setSize(). Scrolling with the wheel on a wheel-equipped mouse is enabled by default. This can be disabled using setWheelScrollingEnabled. Wheel scrolling can be customized by setting the block and unit increment of the horizontal and vertical Adjustables. For information on how mouse wheel events are dispatched, see the class description for MouseWheelEvent. Insets are used to define any space used by scrollbars and any borders created by the scroll pane. getInsets() can be used to get the current value for the insets. If the value of scrollbarsAlwaysVisible is false, then the value of the insets will change dynamically depending on whether the scrollbars are currently visible or not.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Adjustable getVAdjustable()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the ScrollPaneAdjustable object which represents the state of the vertical scrollbar. The declared return type of this method is Adjustable to maintain backward compatibility.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Adjustable getHAdjustable()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the ScrollPaneAdjustable object which represents the state of the horizontal scrollbar. The declared return type of this method is Adjustable to maintain backward compatibility.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setScrollPosition(int x,                       int y)
				</name>
				<description>
					Scrolls to the specified position within the child component. A call to this method is only valid if the scroll pane contains a child. Specifying a position outside of the legal scrolling bounds of the child will scroll to the closest legal position. Legal bounds are defined to be the rectangle: x = 0, y = 0, width = (child width - view port width), height = (child height - view port height). This is a convenience method which interfaces with the Adjustable objects which represent the state of the scrollbars.
