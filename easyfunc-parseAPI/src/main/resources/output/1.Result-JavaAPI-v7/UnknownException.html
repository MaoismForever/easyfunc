		<description>
			The org.omg.CORBA.portable.UnknownException is used for reporting unknown exceptions between ties and ORBs and between ORBs and stubs. It provides a Java representation of an UNKNOWN system exception that has an UnknownExceptionInfo service context. If the CORBA system exception org.omg.CORBA.portable.UnknownException is thrown, then the stub does one of the following: (1) Translates it to org.omg.CORBA.UNKNOWN. (2) Translates it to the nested exception that the UnknownException contains. (3) Passes it on directly to the user.
