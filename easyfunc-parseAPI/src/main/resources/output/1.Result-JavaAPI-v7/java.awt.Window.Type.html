			public static enum Window.Type  extends Enum<Window.Type>
		</name>
		<description>
			Enumeration of available window types. A window type defines the generic visual appearance and behavior of a top-level window. For example, the type may affect the kind of decorations of a decorated Frame or Dialog instance. Some platforms may not fully support a certain window type. Depending on the level of support, some properties of the window type may be disobeyed.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final Window.Type NORMAL
				</name>
				<description>
					Represents a normal window. This is the default type for objects of the Window class or its descendants. Use this type for regular top-level windows.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final Window.Type UTILITY
				</name>
				<description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static Window.Type[] values()
				</name>
