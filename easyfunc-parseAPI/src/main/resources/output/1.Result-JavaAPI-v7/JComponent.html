		<description>
			The base class for all Swing components except top-level containers. To use a component that inherits from JComponent, you must place the component in a containment hierarchy whose root is a top-level Swing container. Top-level Swing containers -- such as JFrame, JDialog, and JApplet -- are specialized components that provide a place for other Swing components to paint themselves. For an explanation of containment hierarchies, see Swing Components and the Containment Hierarchy, a section in The Java Tutorial. The JComponent class provides: The base class for both standard and custom components that use the Swing architecture. A "pluggable look and feel" (L&F) that can be specified by the programmer or (optionally) selected by the user at runtime. The look and feel for each component is provided by a UI delegate -- an object that descends from ComponentUI. See How to Set the Look and Feel in The Java Tutorial for more information. Comprehensive keystroke handling. See the document Keyboard Bindings in Swing, an article in The Swing Connection, for more information. Support for tool tips -- short descriptions that pop up when the cursor lingers over a component. See How to Use Tool Tips in The Java Tutorial for more information. Support for accessibility. JComponent contains all of the methods in the Accessible interface, but it doesn't actually implement the interface. That is the responsibility of the individual classes that extend JComponent. Support for component-specific properties. With the putClientProperty(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object) and getClientProperty(java.lang.Object) methods, you can associate name-object pairs with any object that descends from JComponent. An infrastructure for painting that includes double buffering and support for borders. For more information see Painting and How to Use Borders, both of which are sections in The Java Tutorial. For more information on these subjects, see the Swing package description and The Java Tutorial section The JComponent Class. JComponent and its subclasses document default values for certain properties. For example, JTable documents the default row height as 16. Each JComponent subclass that has a ComponentUI will create the ComponentUI as part of its constructor. In order to provide a particular look and feel each ComponentUI may set properties back on the JComponent that created it. For example, a custom look and feel may require JTables to have a row height of 24. The documented defaults are the value of a property BEFORE the ComponentUI has been installed. If you need a specific value for a particular property you should explicitly set it. In release 1.4, the focus subsystem was rearchitected. For more information, see How to Use the Focus Subsystem, a section in The Java Tutorial. Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more information see Swing's Threading Policy. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

					Default JComponent constructor. This constructor does very little initialization beyond calling the Container constructor. For example, the initial layout manager is null. It does, however, set the component's locale property to the value returned by JComponent.getDefaultLocale.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setInheritsPopupMenu(boolean value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets whether or not getComponentPopupMenu should delegate to the parent if this component does not have a JPopupMenu assigned to it. The default value for this is false, but some JComponent subclasses that are implemented as a number of JComponents may set this to true. This is a bound property.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getInheritsPopupMenu()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the JPopupMenu should be inherited from the parent.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setComponentPopupMenu(JPopupMenu popup)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the JPopupMenu for this JComponent. The UI is responsible for registering bindings and adding the necessary listeners such that the JPopupMenu will be shown at the appropriate time. When the JPopupMenu is shown depends upon the look and feel: some may show it on a mouse event, some may enable a key binding. If popup is null, and getInheritsPopupMenu returns true, then getComponentPopupMenu will be delegated to the parent. This provides for a way to make all child components inherit the popupmenu of the parent. This is a bound property.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public JPopupMenu getComponentPopupMenu()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns JPopupMenu that assigned for this component. If this component does not have a JPopupMenu assigned to it and getInheritsPopupMenu is true, this will return getParent().getComponentPopupMenu() (assuming the parent is valid.)

			<method>
				<name>
					public void updateUI()
				</name>
				<description>
					Resets the UI property to a value from the current look and feel. JComponent subclasses must override this method like this:      public void updateUI() {        setUI((SliderUI)UIManager.getUI(this);     }

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void setUI(ComponentUI newUI)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the look and feel delegate for this component. JComponent subclasses generally override this method to narrow the argument type. For example, in JSlider:    public void setUI(SliderUI newUI) {       super.setUI(newUI);   }    Additionally JComponent subclasses must provide a getUI method that returns the correct type. For example:    public SliderUI getUI() {       return (SliderUI)ui;   }
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getUIClassID()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the UIDefaults key used to look up the name of the swing.plaf.ComponentUI class that defines the look and feel for this component. Most applications will never need to call this method. Subclasses of JComponent that support pluggable look and feel should override this method to return a UIDefaults key that maps to the ComponentUI subclass that defines their look and feel.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected Graphics getComponentGraphics(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the graphics object used to paint this component. If DebugGraphics is turned on we create a new DebugGraphics object if necessary. Otherwise we just configure the specified graphics object's foreground and font.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void paintComponent(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Calls the UI delegate's paint method, if the UI delegate is non-null. We pass the delegate a copy of the Graphics object to protect the rest of the paint code from irrevocable changes (for example, Graphics.translate). If you override this in a subclass you should not make permanent changes to the passed in Graphics. For example, you should not alter the clip Rectangle or modify the transform. If you need to do these operations you may find it easier to create a new Graphics from the passed in Graphics and manipulate it. Further, if you do not invoker super's implementation you must honor the opaque property, that is if this component is opaque, you must completely fill in the background in a non-opaque color. If you do not honor the opaque property you will likely see visual artifacts. The passed in Graphics object might have a transform other than the identify transform installed on it. In this case, you might get unexpected results if you cumulatively apply another transform.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void paintChildren(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Paints this component's children. If shouldUseBuffer is true, no component ancestor has a buffer and the component children can use a buffer if they have one. Otherwise, one ancestor has a buffer currently in use and children should not use a buffer to paint.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void paintBorder(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Paints the component's border. If you override this in a subclass you should not make permanent changes to the passed in Graphics. For example, you should not alter the clip Rectangle or modify the transform. If you need to do these operations you may find it easier to create a new Graphics from the passed in Graphics and manipulate it.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void update(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Calls paint. Doesn't clear the background but see ComponentUI.update, which is called by paintComponent.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void paint(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Invoked by Swing to draw components. Applications should not invoke paint directly, but should instead use the repaint method to schedule the component for redrawing. This method actually delegates the work of painting to three protected methods: paintComponent, paintBorder, and paintChildren. They're called in the order listed to ensure that children appear on top of component itself. Generally speaking, the component and its children should not paint in the insets area allocated to the border. Subclasses can just override this method, as always. A subclass that just wants to specialize the UI (look and feel) delegate's paint method should just override paintComponent.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void printAll(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Invoke this method to print the component. This method invokes print on the component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void print(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Invoke this method to print the component to the specified Graphics. This method will result in invocations of printComponent, printBorder and printChildren. It is recommended that you override one of the previously mentioned methods rather than this one if your intention is to customize the way printing looks. However, it can be useful to override this method should you want to prepare state before invoking the superclass behavior. As an example, if you wanted to change the component's background color before printing, you could do the following:        public void print(Graphics g) {           Color orig = getBackground();           setBackground(Color.WHITE);             // wrap in try/finally so that we always restore the state           try {               super.print(g);           } finally {               setBackground(orig);           }       }   Alternatively, or for components that delegate painting to other objects, you can query during painting whether or not the component is in the midst of a print operation. The isPaintingForPrint method provides this ability and its return value will be changed by this method: to true immediately before rendering and to false immediately after. With each change a property change event is fired on this component with the name "paintingForPrint". This method sets the component's state such that the double buffer will not be used: painting will be done directly on the passed in Graphics.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void printComponent(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					This is invoked during a printing operation. This is implemented to invoke paintComponent on the component. Override this if you wish to add special painting behavior when printing.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void printChildren(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Prints this component's children. This is implemented to invoke paintChildren on the component. Override this if you wish to print the children differently than painting.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void printBorder(Graphics g)
				</name>
				<description>
					Prints the component's border. This is implemented to invoke paintBorder on the component. Override this if you wish to print the border differently that it is painted.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isPaintingTile()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the component is currently painting a tile. If this method returns true, paint will be called again for another tile. This method returns false if you are not painting a tile or if the last tile is painted. Use this method to keep some state you might need between tiles.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final boolean isPaintingForPrint()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the current painting operation on this component is part of a print operation. This method is useful when you want to customize what you print versus what you show on the screen. You can detect changes in the value of this property by listening for property change events on this component with name "paintingForPrint". Note: This method provides complimentary functionality to that provided by other high level Swing printing APIs. However, it deals strictly with painting and should not be confused as providing information on higher level print processes. For example, a JTable.print() operation doesn't necessarily result in a continuous rendering of the full component, and the return value of this method can change multiple times during that operation. It is even possible for the component to be painted to the screen while the printing process is ongoing. In such a case, the return value of this method is true when, and only when, the table is being painted as part of the printing process.

			<method>
				<name>
					@Deprecated  public boolean isManagingFocus()
				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated. As of 1.4, replaced by Component.setFocusTraversalKeys(int, Set) and Container.setFocusCycleRoot(boolean). In release 1.4, the focus subsystem was rearchitected. For more information, see How to Use the Focus Subsystem, a section in The Java Tutorial. Changes this JComponent's focus traversal keys to CTRL+TAB and CTRL+SHIFT+TAB. Also prevents SortingFocusTraversalPolicy from considering descendants of this JComponent when computing a focus traversal cycle.

			<method>
				<name>
					@Deprecated  public void setNextFocusableComponent(Component aComponent)
				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated. As of 1.4, replaced by FocusTraversalPolicy In release 1.4, the focus subsystem was rearchitected. For more information, see How to Use the Focus Subsystem, a section in The Java Tutorial. Overrides the default FocusTraversalPolicy for this JComponent's focus traversal cycle by unconditionally setting the specified Component as the next Component in the cycle, and this JComponent as the specified Component's previous Component in the cycle.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					@Deprecated  public Component getNextFocusableComponent()
				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated. As of 1.4, replaced by FocusTraversalPolicy. In release 1.4, the focus subsystem was rearchitected. For more information, see How to Use the Focus Subsystem, a section in The Java Tutorial. Returns the Component set by a prior call to setNextFocusableComponent(Component) on this JComponent.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setRequestFocusEnabled(boolean requestFocusEnabled)
				</name>
				<description>
					Provides a hint as to whether or not this JComponent should get focus. This is only a hint, and it is up to consumers that are requesting focus to honor this property. This is typically honored for mouse operations, but not keyboard operations. For example, look and feels could verify this property is true before requesting focus during a mouse operation. This would often times be used if you did not want a mouse press on a JComponent to steal focus, but did want the JComponent to be traversable via the keyboard. If you do not want this JComponent focusable at all, use the setFocusable method instead. Please see How to Use the Focus Subsystem, a section in The Java Tutorial, for more information.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isRequestFocusEnabled()

					public void requestFocus()
				</name>
				<description>
					Requests that this Component gets the input focus. Refer to Component.requestFocus() for a complete description of this method. Note that the use of this method is discouraged because its behavior is platform dependent. Instead we recommend the use of requestFocusInWindow().

				</name>
				<description>
					Requests that this Component get the input focus, and that this Component's top-level ancestor become the focused Window. This component must be displayable, visible, and focusable for the request to be granted. This method is intended for use by focus implementations. Client code should not use this method; instead, it should use requestFocusInWindow().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setVerifyInputWhenFocusTarget(boolean verifyInputWhenFocusTarget)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the value to indicate whether input verifier for the current focus owner will be called before this component requests focus. The default is true. Set to false on components such as a Cancel button or a scrollbar, which should activate even if the input in the current focus owner is not "passed" by the input verifier for that component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getVerifyInputWhenFocusTarget()
				</name>

					public void setPreferredSize(Dimension preferredSize)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the preferred size of this component. If preferredSize is null, the UI will be asked for the preferred size.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Dimension getPreferredSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					If the preferredSize has been set to a non-null value just returns it. If the UI delegate's getPreferredSize method returns a non null value then return that; otherwise defer to the component's layout manager.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setMaximumSize(Dimension maximumSize)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the maximum size of this component to a constant value. Subsequent calls to getMaximumSize will always return this value; the component's UI will not be asked to compute it. Setting the maximum size to null restores the default behavior.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Dimension getMaximumSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					If the maximum size has been set to a non-null value just returns it. If the UI delegate's getMaximumSize method returns a non-null value then return that; otherwise defer to the component's layout manager.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>

					public void setMinimumSize(Dimension minimumSize)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the minimum size of this component to a constant value. Subsequent calls to getMinimumSize will always return this value; the component's UI will not be asked to compute it. Setting the minimum size to null restores the default behavior.

				<description>
					Gives the UI delegate an opportunity to define the precise shape of this component for the sake of mouse processing.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setBorder(Border border)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the border of this component. The Border object is responsible for defining the insets for the component (overriding any insets set directly on the component) and for optionally rendering any border decorations within the bounds of those insets. Borders should be used (rather than insets) for creating both decorative and non-decorative (such as margins and padding) regions for a swing component. Compound borders can be used to nest multiple borders within a single component. Although technically you can set the border on any object that inherits from JComponent, the look and feel implementation of many standard Swing components doesn't work well with user-set borders. In general, when you want to set a border on a standard Swing component other than JPanel or JLabel, we recommend that you put the component in a JPanel and set the border on the JPanel. This is a bound property.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Border getBorder()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the border of this component or null if no border is currently set.

			<method>
				<name>
					public Insets getInsets()
				</name>
				<description>
					If a border has been set on this component, returns the border's insets; otherwise calls super.getInsets.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Insets getInsets(Insets insets)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an Insets object containing this component's inset values. The passed-in Insets object will be reused if possible. Calling methods cannot assume that the same object will be returned, however. All existing values within this object are overwritten. If insets is null, this will allocate a new one.

					public void registerKeyboardAction(ActionListener anAction,                            String aCommand,                            KeyStroke aKeyStroke,                            int aCondition)
				</name>
				<description>
					This method is now obsolete, please use a combination of getActionMap() and getInputMap() for similiar behavior. For example, to bind the KeyStroke aKeyStroke to the Action anAction now use:      component.getInputMap().put(aKeyStroke, aCommand);     component.getActionMap().put(aCommmand, anAction);   The above assumes you want the binding to be applicable for WHEN_FOCUSED. To register bindings for other focus states use the getInputMap method that takes an integer. Register a new keyboard action. anAction will be invoked if a key event matching aKeyStroke occurs and aCondition is verified. The KeyStroke object defines a particular combination of a keyboard key and one or more modifiers (alt, shift, ctrl, meta). The aCommand will be set in the delivered event if specified. The aCondition can be one of: WHEN_FOCUSED The action will be invoked only when the keystroke occurs while the component has the focus. WHEN_IN_FOCUSED_WINDOW The action will be invoked when the keystroke occurs while the component has the focus or if the component is in the window that has the focus. Note that the component need not be an immediate descendent of the window -- it can be anywhere in the window's containment hierarchy. In other words, whenever any component in the window has the focus, the action registered with this component is invoked. WHEN_ANCESTOR_OF_FOCUSED_COMPONENT The action will be invoked when the keystroke occurs while the component has the focus or if the component is an ancestor of the component that has the focus. The combination of keystrokes and conditions lets you define high level (semantic) action events for a specified keystroke+modifier combination (using the KeyStroke class) and direct to a parent or child of a component that has the focus, or to the component itself. In other words, in any hierarchical structure of components, an arbitrary key-combination can be immediately directed to the appropriate component in the hierarchy, and cause a specific method to be invoked (usually by way of adapter objects). If an action has already been registered for the receiving container, with the same charCode and the same modifiers, anAction will replace the action.

				</name>
				<description>
					This method is now obsolete. To unregister an existing binding you can either remove the binding from the ActionMap/InputMap, or place a dummy binding the InputMap. Removing the binding from the InputMap allows bindings in parent InputMaps to be active, whereas putting a dummy binding in the InputMap effectively disables the binding from ever happening. Unregisters a keyboard action. This will remove the binding from the ActionMap (if it exists) as well as the InputMaps.

				<description>
					Returns the baseline. The baseline is measured from the top of the component. This method is primarily meant for LayoutManagers to align components along their baseline. A return value less than 0 indicates this component does not have a reasonable baseline and that LayoutManagers should not align this component on its baseline. This method calls into the ComponentUI method of the same name. If this component does not have a ComponentUI -1 will be returned. If a value >= 0 is returned, then the component has a valid baseline for any size >= the minimum size and getBaselineResizeBehavior can be used to determine how the baseline changes with size.

					Returns an enum indicating how the baseline of the component changes as the size changes. This method is primarily meant for layout managers and GUI builders. This method calls into the ComponentUI method of the same name. If this component does not have a ComponentUI BaselineResizeBehavior.OTHER will be returned. Subclasses should never return null; if the baseline can not be calculated return BaselineResizeBehavior.OTHER. Callers should first ask for the baseline using getBaseline and if a value >= 0 is returned use this method. It is acceptable for this method to return a value other than BaselineResizeBehavior.OTHER even if getBaseline returns a value less than 0.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setAutoscrolls(boolean autoscrolls)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the autoscrolls property. If true mouse dragged events will be synthetically generated when the mouse is dragged outside of the component's bounds and mouse motion has paused (while the button continues to be held down). The synthetic events make it appear that the drag gesture has resumed in the direction established when the component's boundary was crossed. Components that support autoscrolling must handle mouseDragged events by calling scrollRectToVisible with a rectangle that contains the mouse event's location. All of the Swing components that support item selection and are typically displayed in a JScrollPane (JTable, JList, JTree, JTextArea, and JEditorPane) already handle mouse dragged events in this way. To enable autoscrolling in any other component, add a mouse motion listener that calls scrollRectToVisible. For example, given a JPanel, myPanel:    MouseMotionListener doScrollRectToVisible = new MouseMotionAdapter() {       public void mouseDragged(MouseEvent e) {          Rectangle r = new Rectangle(e.getX(), e.getY(), 1, 1);          ((JPanel)e.getSource()).scrollRectToVisible(r);      }   };   myPanel.addMouseMotionListener(doScrollRectToVisible);   The default value of the autoScrolls property is false.

					public void setTransferHandler(TransferHandler newHandler)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the TransferHandler, which provides support for transfer of data into and out of this component via cut/copy/paste and drag and drop. This may be null if the component does not support data transfer operations. If the new TransferHandler is not null, this method also installs a new DropTarget on the component to activate drop handling through the TransferHandler and activate any built-in support (such as calculating and displaying potential drop locations). If you do not wish for this component to respond in any way to drops, you can disable drop support entirely either by removing the drop target (setDropTarget(null)) or by de-activating it (getDropTaget().setActive(false)). If the new TransferHandler is null, this method removes the drop target. Under two circumstances, this method does not modify the drop target: First, if the existing drop target on this component was explicitly set by the developer to a non-null value. Second, if the system property suppressSwingDropSupport is true. The default value for the system property is false. Please see How to Use Drag and Drop and Data Transfer, a section in The Java Tutorial, for more information.

					public final void putClientProperty(Object key,                       Object value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds an arbitrary key/value "client property" to this component. The get/putClientProperty methods provide access to a small per-instance hashtable. Callers can use get/putClientProperty to annotate components that were created by another module. For example, a layout manager might store per child constraints this way. For example:    componentA.putClientProperty("to the left of", componentB);   If value is null this method will remove the property. Changes to client properties are reported with PropertyChange events. The name of the property (for the sake of PropertyChange events) is key.toString(). The clientProperty dictionary is not intended to support large scale extensions to JComponent nor should be it considered an alternative to subclassing when designing a new component.

				<description>
					Returns true if this component is completely opaque. An opaque component paints every pixel within its rectangular bounds. A non-opaque component paints only a subset of its pixels or none at all, allowing the pixels underneath it to "show through". Therefore, a component that does not fully paint its pixels provides a degree of transparency. Subclasses that guarantee to always completely paint their contents should override this method and return true.

				<name>
					public void addNotify()
				</name>
				<description>
					Notifies this component that it now has a parent component. When this method is invoked, the chain of parent components is set up with KeyboardAction event listeners. This method is called by the toolkit internally and should not be called directly by programs.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public void removeNotify()
				</name>
				<description>
					Notifies this component that it no longer has a parent component. When this method is invoked, any KeyboardActions set up in the the chain of parent components are removed. This method is called by the toolkit internally and should not be called directly by programs.

				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the specified region to the dirty region list if the component is showing. The component will be repainted after all of the currently pending events have been dispatched.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void revalidate()
				</name>
				<description>
					Supports deferred automatic layout. Calls invalidate and then adds this component's validateRoot to a list of components that need to be validated. Validation will occur after all currently pending events have been dispatched. In other words after this method is called, the first validateRoot (if any) found when walking up the containment hierarchy of this component will be validated. By default, JRootPane, JScrollPane, and JTextField return true from isValidateRoot. This method will automatically be called on this component when a property value changes such that size, location, or internal layout of this component has been affected. This automatic updating differs from the AWT because programs generally no longer need to invoke validate to get the contents of the GUI to update.

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isValidateRoot()
				</name>
				<description>
					If this method returns true, revalidate calls by descendants of this component will cause the entire tree beginning with this root to be validated. Returns false by default. JScrollPane overrides this method and returns true.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isOptimizedDrawingEnabled()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this component tiles its children -- that is, if it can guarantee that the children will not overlap. The repainting system is substantially more efficient in this common case. JComponent subclasses that can't make this guarantee, such as JLayeredPane, should override this method to return false.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected boolean isPaintingOrigin()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if a paint triggered on a child component should cause painting to originate from this Component, or one of its ancestors. Calling repaint(long, int, int, int, int) or paintImmediately(int, int, int, int) on a Swing component will result in calling the paintImmediately(int, int, int, int) method of the first ancestor which isPaintingOrigin() returns true, if there are any. JComponent subclasses that need to be painted when any of their children are repainted should override this method to return true.

					public void paintImmediately(int x,                      int y,                      int w,                      int h)
				</name>
				<description>
					Paints the specified region in this component and all of its descendants that overlap the region, immediately. It's rarely necessary to call this method. In most cases it's more efficient to call repaint, which defers the actual painting and can collapse redundant requests into a single paint call. This method is useful if one needs to update the display while the current event is being dispatched. This method is to be overridden when the dirty region needs to be changed for components that are painting origins.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setDoubleBuffered(boolean aFlag)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets whether this component should use a buffer to paint. If set to true, all the drawing from this component will be done in an offscreen painting buffer. The offscreen painting buffer will the be copied onto the screen. If a Component is buffered and one of its ancestor is also buffered, the ancestor buffer will be used.

				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this JComponent. This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations. The returned string may be empty but may not be null.
