		<description>
			A Constraints object holds the constraints that govern the way a component's size and position change in a container controlled by a SpringLayout. A Constraints object is like a Rectangle, in that it has x, y, width, and height properties. In the Constraints object, however, these properties have Spring values instead of integers. In addition, a Constraints object can be manipulated as four edges -- north, south, east, and west -- using the constraint property. The following formulas are always true for a Constraints object (here WEST and x are synonyms, as are and NORTH and y):                  EAST = WEST + WIDTH                SOUTH = NORTH + HEIGHT    HORIZONTAL_CENTER = WEST + WIDTH/2      VERTICAL_CENTER = NORTH + HEIGHT/2    ABSOLUTE_BASELINE = NORTH + RELATIVE_BASELINE*   For example, if you have specified the WIDTH and WEST (X) location the EAST is calculated as WEST + WIDTH. If you instead specified the WIDTH and EAST locations the WEST (X) location is then calculated as EAST - WIDTH. [RELATIVE_BASELINE is a private constraint that is set automatically when the SpringLayout.Constraints(Component) constuctor is called or when a constraints object is registered with a SpringLayout object.] Note: In this document, operators represent methods in the Spring class. For example, "a + b" is equal to Spring.sum(a, b), and "a - b" is equal to Spring.sum(a, Spring.minus(b)). See the Spring API documentation for further details of spring arithmetic. Because a Constraints object's properties -- representing its edges, size, and location -- can all be set independently and yet are interrelated, a Constraints object can become over-constrained. For example, if the WEST, WIDTH and EAST edges are all set, steps must be taken to ensure that the first of the formulas above holds. To do this, the Constraints object throws away the least recently set constraint so as to make the formulas hold.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public SpringLayout.Constraints()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates an empty Constraints object.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public SpringLayout.Constraints(Spring x,                          Spring y)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a Constraints object with the specified values for its x and y properties. The height and width springs have null values.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public SpringLayout.Constraints(Spring x,                          Spring y,                          Spring width,                          Spring height)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a Constraints object with the specified values for its x, y, width, and height properties. Note: If the SpringLayout class encounters null values in the Constraints object of a given component, it replaces them with suitable defaults.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public SpringLayout.Constraints(Component c)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a Constraints object with suitable x, y, width and height springs for component, c. The x and y springs are constant springs initialised with the component's location at the time this method is called. The width and height springs are special springs, created by the Spring.width() and Spring.height() methods, which track the size characteristics of the component when they change.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setX(Spring x)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the x property, which controls the x value of a component's location.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Spring getX()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value of the x property.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setY(Spring y)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the y property, which controls the y value of a component's location.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Spring getY()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value of the y property.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setWidth(Spring width)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the width property, which controls the width of a component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Spring getWidth()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value of the width property.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setHeight(Spring height)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the height property, which controls the height of a component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Spring getHeight()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value of the height property.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setConstraint(String edgeName,                   Spring s)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the spring controlling the specified edge. The edge must have one of the following values: SpringLayout.NORTH, SpringLayout.SOUTH, SpringLayout.EAST, SpringLayout.WEST, SpringLayout.HORIZONTAL_CENTER, SpringLayout.VERTICAL_CENTER, SpringLayout.BASELINE, SpringLayout.WIDTH or SpringLayout.HEIGHT. For any other String value passed as the edge, no action is taken. For a null edge, a NullPointerException is thrown. Note: This method can affect x and y values previously set for this Constraints.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Spring getConstraint(String edgeName)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value of the specified edge, which may be a derived value, or even null. The edge must have one of the following values: SpringLayout.NORTH, SpringLayout.SOUTH, SpringLayout.EAST, SpringLayout.WEST, SpringLayout.HORIZONTAL_CENTER, SpringLayout.VERTICAL_CENTER, SpringLayout.BASELINE, SpringLayout.WIDTH or SpringLayout.HEIGHT. For any other String value passed as the edge, null will be returned. Throws NullPointerException for a null edge.
