			public class X509CRLSelector  extends Object  implements CRLSelector
		</name>
		<description>
			A CRLSelector that selects X509CRLs that match all specified criteria. This class is particularly useful when selecting CRLs from a CertStore to check revocation status of a particular certificate. When first constructed, an X509CRLSelector has no criteria enabled and each of the get methods return a default value (null). Therefore, the match method would return true for any X509CRL. Typically, several criteria are enabled (by calling setIssuers or setDateAndTime, for instance) and then the X509CRLSelector is passed to CertStore.getCRLs or some similar method. Please refer to RFC 3280: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile for definitions of the X.509 CRL fields and extensions mentioned below. Concurrent Access Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating separate objects need not synchronize.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public X509CRLSelector()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates an X509CRLSelector. Initially, no criteria are set so any X509CRL will match.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setIssuers(Collection<X500Principal> issuers)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished name in the X509CRL must match at least one of the specified distinguished names. If null, any issuer distinguished name will do. This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call, the complete set of issuer names which X509CRLs may contain. The specified value replaces the previous value for the issuerNames criterion. The names parameter (if not null) is a Collection of X500Principals. Note that the names parameter can contain duplicate distinguished names, but they may be removed from the Collection of names returned by the getIssuers method. Note that a copy is performed on the Collection to protect against subsequent modifications.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setIssuerNames(Collection<?> names)                      throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Note: use setIssuers(Collection) instead or only specify the byte array form of distinguished names when using this method. See addIssuerName(String) for more information. Sets the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished name in the X509CRL must match at least one of the specified distinguished names. If null, any issuer distinguished name will do. This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call, the complete set of issuer names which X509CRLs may contain. The specified value replaces the previous value for the issuerNames criterion. The names parameter (if not null) is a Collection of names. Each name is a String or a byte array representing a distinguished name (in RFC 2253 or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively). If null is supplied as the value for this argument, no issuerNames check will be performed. Note that the names parameter can contain duplicate distinguished names, but they may be removed from the Collection of names returned by the getIssuerNames method. If a name is specified as a byte array, it should contain a single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is as follows.    Name ::= CHOICE {     RDNSequence }     RDNSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedName     RelativeDistinguishedName ::=     SET SIZE (1 .. MAX) OF AttributeTypeAndValue     AttributeTypeAndValue ::= SEQUENCE {     type     AttributeType,     value    AttributeValue }     AttributeType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER     AttributeValue ::= ANY DEFINED BY AttributeType   ....   DirectoryString ::= CHOICE {         teletexString           TeletexString (SIZE (1..MAX)),         printableString         PrintableString (SIZE (1..MAX)),         universalString         UniversalString (SIZE (1..MAX)),         utf8String              UTF8String (SIZE (1.. MAX)),         bmpString               BMPString (SIZE (1..MAX)) }   Note that a deep copy is performed on the Collection to protect against subsequent modifications.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void addIssuer(X500Principal issuer)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a name to the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished name in the X509CRL must match at least one of the specified distinguished names. This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of issuer names which X509CRLs may contain. The specified name is added to any previous value for the issuerNames criterion. If the specified name is a duplicate, it may be ignored.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void addIssuerName(String name)                     throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Denigrated, use addIssuer(X500Principal) or addIssuerName(byte[]) instead. This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some CRLs because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253 String form of some distinguished names. Adds a name to the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished name in the X509CRL must match at least one of the specified distinguished names. This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of issuer names which X509CRLs may contain. The specified name is added to any previous value for the issuerNames criterion. If the specified name is a duplicate, it may be ignored.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void addIssuerName(byte[] name)                     throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a name to the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished name in the X509CRL must match at least one of the specified distinguished names. This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of issuer names which X509CRLs may contain. The specified name is added to any previous value for the issuerNames criterion. If the specified name is a duplicate, it may be ignored. If a name is specified as a byte array, it should contain a single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is as follows. The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain a single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1 notation for this structure appears in the documentation for setIssuerNames(Collection names). Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

					public void setMinCRLNumber(BigInteger minCRL)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the minCRLNumber criterion. The X509CRL must have a CRL number extension whose value is greater than or equal to the specified value. If null, no minCRLNumber check will be done.

					Sets the dateAndTime criterion. The specified date must be equal to or later than the value of the thisUpdate component of the X509CRL and earlier than the value of the nextUpdate component. There is no match if the X509CRL does not contain a nextUpdate component. If null, no dateAndTime check will be done. Note that the Date supplied here is cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setCertificateChecking(X509Certificate cert)
				</name>
				<description>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Collection<X500Principal> getIssuers()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the issuerNames criterion. The issuer distinguished name in the X509CRL must match at least one of the specified distinguished names.

If a name is specified as a byte array, it should contain a single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is given in the documentation for setIssuerNames(Collection names). Note that a deep copy is performed on the Collection to protect against subsequent modifications.
