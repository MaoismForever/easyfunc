			Default data model for list selections. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the selection mode. The following list describes the accepted selection modes: ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_SELECTION - Only one list index can be selected at a time. In this mode, setSelectionInterval and addSelectionInterval are equivalent, both replacing the current selection with the index represented by the second argument (the "lead"). ListSelectionModel.SINGLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION - Only one contiguous interval can be selected at a time. In this mode, addSelectionInterval behaves like setSelectionInterval (replacing the current selection), unless the given interval is immediately adjacent to or overlaps the existing selection, and can therefore be used to grow it. ListSelectionModel.MULTIPLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION - In this mode, there's no restriction on what can be selected.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of all the objects currently registered as FooListeners upon this model. FooListeners are registered using the addFooListener method. You can specify the listenerType argument with a class literal, such as FooListener.class. For example, you can query a DefaultListSelectionModel instance m for its list selection listeners with the following code: ListSelectionListener[] lsls = (ListSelectionListener[])(m.getListeners(ListSelectionListener.class)); If no such listeners exist, this method returns an empty array.

					public void setLeadAnchorNotificationEnabled(boolean flag)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the value of the leadAnchorNotificationEnabled flag.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isLeadAnchorNotificationEnabled()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value of the leadAnchorNotificationEnabled flag. When leadAnchorNotificationEnabled is true the model generates notification events with bounds that cover all the changes to the selection plus the changes to the lead and anchor indices. Setting the flag to false causes a narrowing of the event's bounds to include only the elements that have been selected or deselected since the last change. Either way, the model continues to maintain the lead and anchor variables internally. The default is true. Note: It is possible for the lead or anchor to be changed without a change to the selection. Notification of these changes is often important, such as when the new lead or anchor needs to be updated in the view. Therefore, caution is urged when changing the default value.

				<name>
					public void clearSelection()
				</name>
				<description>
					Change the selection to the empty set. If this represents a change to the current selection then notify each ListSelectionListener.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setSelectionInterval(int index0,                          int index1)
				</name>
				<description>
					Changes the selection to be between index0 and index1 inclusive. index0 doesn't have to be less than or equal to index1. In SINGLE_SELECTION selection mode, only the second index is used. If this represents a change to the current selection, then each ListSelectionListener is notified of the change. If either index is -1, this method does nothing and returns without exception. Otherwise, if either index is less than -1, an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public void addSelectionInterval(int index0,                          int index1)
				</name>
				<description>
					Changes the selection to be the set union of the current selection and the indices between index0 and index1 inclusive. In SINGLE_SELECTION selection mode, this is equivalent to calling setSelectionInterval, and only the second index is used. In SINGLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION selection mode, this method behaves like setSelectionInterval, unless the given interval is immediately adjacent to or overlaps the existing selection, and can therefore be used to grow it. If this represents a change to the current selection, then each ListSelectionListener is notified of the change. Note that index0 doesn't have to be less than or equal to index1. If either index is -1, this method does nothing and returns without exception. Otherwise, if either index is less than -1, an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.

				<name>
					public void removeSelectionInterval(int index0,                             int index1)
				</name>
				<description>
					Changes the selection to be the set difference of the current selection and the indices between index0 and index1 inclusive. index0 doesn't have to be less than or equal to index1. In SINGLE_INTERVAL_SELECTION selection mode, if the removal would produce two disjoint selections, the removal is extended through the greater end of the selection. For example, if the selection is 0-10 and you supply indices 5,6 (in any order) the resulting selection is 0-4. If this represents a change to the current selection, then each ListSelectionListener is notified of the change. If either index is -1, this method does nothing and returns without exception. Otherwise, if either index is less than -1, an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.

				</name>
				<description>
					Insert length indices beginning before/after index. If the value at index is itself selected and the selection mode is not SINGLE_SELECTION, set all of the newly inserted items as selected. Otherwise leave them unselected. This method is typically called to sync the selection model with a corresponding change in the data model.

				<name>
					public void removeIndexInterval(int index0,                         int index1)
				</name>
				<description>
					Remove the indices in the interval index0,index1 (inclusive) from the selection model. This is typically called to sync the selection model width a corresponding change in the data model. Note that (as always) index0 need not be <= index1.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setValueIsAdjusting(boolean isAdjusting)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the valueIsAdjusting property, which indicates whether or not upcoming selection changes should be considered part of a single change. The value of this property is used to initialize the valueIsAdjusting property of the ListSelectionEvents that are generated. For example, if the selection is being updated in response to a user drag, this property can be set to true when the drag is initiated and set to false when the drag is finished. During the drag, listeners receive events with a valueIsAdjusting property set to true. At the end of the drag, when the change is finalized, listeners receive an event with the value set to false. Listeners can use this pattern if they wish to update only when a change has been finalized. Setting this property to true begins a series of changes that is to be considered part of a single change. When the property is changed back to false, an event is sent out characterizing the entire selection change (if there was one), with the event's valueIsAdjusting property set to false.

					public Object clone()               throws CloneNotSupportedException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a clone of this selection model with the same selection. listenerLists are not duplicated.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getAnchorSelectionIndex()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the first index argument from the most recent call to setSelectionInterval(), addSelectionInterval() or removeSelectionInterval(). The most recent index0 is considered the "anchor" and the most recent index1 is considered the "lead". Some interfaces display these indices specially, e.g. Windows95 displays the lead index with a dotted yellow outline.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getLeadSelectionIndex()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the second index argument from the most recent call to setSelectionInterval(), addSelectionInterval() or removeSelectionInterval().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setAnchorSelectionIndex(int anchorIndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the anchor selection index, leaving all selection values unchanged. If leadAnchorNotificationEnabled is true, send a notification covering the old and new anchor cells.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void moveLeadSelectionIndex(int leadIndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the lead selection index, leaving all selection values unchanged. If leadAnchorNotificationEnabled is true, send a notification covering the old and new lead cells.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setLeadSelectionIndex(int leadIndex)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the lead selection index, ensuring that values between the anchor and the new lead are either all selected or all deselected. If the value at the anchor index is selected, first clear all the values in the range [anchor, oldLeadIndex], then select all the values values in the range [anchor, newLeadIndex], where oldLeadIndex is the old leadIndex and newLeadIndex is the new one. If the value at the anchor index is not selected, do the same thing in reverse selecting values in the old range and deslecting values in the new one. Generate a single event for this change and notify all listeners. For the purposes of generating minimal bounds in this event, do the operation in a single pass; that way the first and last index inside the ListSelectionEvent that is broadcast will refer to cells that actually changed value because of this method. If, instead, this operation were done in two steps the effect on the selection state would be the same but two events would be generated and the bounds around the changed values would be wider, including cells that had been first cleared only to later be set. This method can be used in the mouseDragged method of a UI class to extend a selection.
