			public class SQLWarning  extends SQLException
		</name>
		<description>
			An exception that provides information on database access warnings. Warnings are silently chained to the object whose method caused it to be reported. Warnings may be retrieved from Connection, Statement, and ResultSet objects. Trying to retrieve a warning on a connection after it has been closed will cause an exception to be thrown. Similarly, trying to retrieve a warning on a statement after it has been closed or on a result set after it has been closed will cause an exception to be thrown. Note that closing a statement also closes a result set that it might have produced.
