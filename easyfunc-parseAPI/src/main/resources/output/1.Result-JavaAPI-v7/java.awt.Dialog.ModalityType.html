			public static enum Dialog.ModalityType  extends Enum<Dialog.ModalityType>
		</name>
		<description>
			Modal dialogs block all input to some top-level windows. Whether a particular window is blocked depends on dialog's type of modality; this is called the "scope of blocking". The ModalityType enum specifies modal types and their associated scopes.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final Dialog.ModalityType MODELESS
				</name>
				<description>
					MODELESS dialog doesn't block any top-level windows.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final Dialog.ModalityType DOCUMENT_MODAL
				</name>
				<description>
					A DOCUMENT_MODAL dialog blocks input to all top-level windows from the same document except those from its own child hierarchy. A document is a top-level window without an owner. It may contain child windows that, together with the top-level window are treated as a single solid document. Since every top-level window must belong to some document, its root can be found as the top-nearest window without an owner.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final Dialog.ModalityType APPLICATION_MODAL
				</name>
				<description>
					An APPLICATION_MODAL dialog blocks all top-level windows from the same Java application except those from its own child hierarchy. If there are several applets launched in a browser, they can be treated either as separate applications or a single one. This behavior is implementation-dependent.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final Dialog.ModalityType TOOLKIT_MODAL
				</name>
				<description>
					A TOOLKIT_MODAL dialog blocks all top-level windows run from the same toolkit except those from its own child hierarchy. If there are several applets launched in a browser, all of them run with the same toolkit; thus, a toolkit-modal dialog displayed by an applet may affect other applets and all windows of the browser instance which embeds the Java runtime environment for this toolkit. Special AWTPermission "toolkitModality" must be granted to use toolkit-modal dialogs. If a TOOLKIT_MODAL dialog is being created and this permission is not granted, a SecurityException will be thrown, and no dialog will be created. If a modality type is being changed to TOOLKIT_MODAL and this permission is not granted, a SecurityException will be thrown, and the modality type will be left unchanged.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static Dialog.ModalityType[] values()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array containing the constants of this enum type, in the order they are declared. This method may be used to iterate over the constants as follows:   for (Dialog.ModalityType c : Dialog.ModalityType.values())      System.out.println(c);
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static Dialog.ModalityType valueOf(String name)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the enum constant of this type with the specified name. The string must match exactly an identifier used to declare an enum constant in this type. (Extraneous whitespace characters are not permitted.)
