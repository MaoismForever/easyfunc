		<description>
			The class Math contains methods for performing basic numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm, square root, and trigonometric functions. Unlike some of the numeric methods of class StrictMath, all implementations of the equivalent functions of class Math are not defined to return the bit-for-bit same results. This relaxation permits better-performing implementations where strict reproducibility is not required. By default many of the Math methods simply call the equivalent method in StrictMath for their implementation. Code generators are encouraged to use platform-specific native libraries or microprocessor instructions, where available, to provide higher-performance implementations of Math methods. Such higher-performance implementations still must conform to the specification for Math. The quality of implementation specifications concern two properties, accuracy of the returned result and monotonicity of the method. Accuracy of the floating-point Math methods is measured in terms of ulps, units in the last place. For a given floating-point format, an ulp of a specific real number value is the distance between the two floating-point values bracketing that numerical value. When discussing the accuracy of a method as a whole rather than at a specific argument, the number of ulps cited is for the worst-case error at any argument. If a method always has an error less than 0.5 ulps, the method always returns the floating-point number nearest the exact result; such a method is correctly rounded. A correctly rounded method is generally the best a floating-point approximation can be; however, it is impractical for many floating-point methods to be correctly rounded. Instead, for the Math class, a larger error bound of 1 or 2 ulps is allowed for certain methods. Informally, with a 1 ulp error bound, when the exact result is a representable number, the exact result should be returned as the computed result; otherwise, either of the two floating-point values which bracket the exact result may be returned. For exact results large in magnitude, one of the endpoints of the bracket may be infinite. Besides accuracy at individual arguments, maintaining proper relations between the method at different arguments is also important. Therefore, most methods with more than 0.5 ulp errors are required to be semi-monotonic: whenever the mathematical function is non-decreasing, so is the floating-point approximation, likewise, whenever the mathematical function is non-increasing, so is the floating-point approximation. Not all approximations that have 1 ulp accuracy will automatically meet the monotonicity requirements.

If the absolute value of the first argument is greater than 1 and the second argument is negative infinity, or the absolute value of the first argument is less than 1 and the second argument is positive infinity, then the result is positive zero. If the absolute value of the first argument equals 1 and the second argument is infinite, then the result is NaN. If the first argument is positive zero and the second argument is greater than zero, or the first argument is positive infinity and the second argument is less than zero, then the result is positive zero. If the first argument is positive zero and the second argument is less than zero, or the first argument is positive infinity and the second argument is greater than zero, then the result is positive infinity. If the first argument is negative zero and the second argument is greater than zero but not a finite odd integer, or the first argument is negative infinity and the second argument is less than zero but not a finite odd integer, then the result is positive zero. If the first argument is negative zero and the second argument is a positive finite odd integer, or the first argument is negative infinity and the second argument is a negative finite odd integer, then the result is negative zero. If the first argument is negative zero and the second argument is less than zero but not a finite odd integer, or the first argument is negative infinity and the second argument is greater than zero but not a finite odd integer, then the result is positive infinity.

If both arguments are integers, then the result is exactly equal to the mathematical result of raising the first argument to the power of the second argument if that result can in fact be represented exactly as a double value. (In the foregoing descriptions, a floating-point value is considered to be an integer if and only if it is finite and a fixed point of the method ceil or, equivalently, a fixed point of the method floor. A value is a fixed point of a one-argument method if and only if the result of applying the method to the value is equal to the value.) The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result. Results must be semi-monotonic.

					public static double random()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately) uniform distribution from that range. When this method is first called, it creates a single new pseudorandom-number generator, exactly as if by the expression new java.util.Random() This new pseudorandom-number generator is used thereafter for all calls to this method and is used nowhere else. This method is properly synchronized to allow correct use by more than one thread. However, if many threads need to generate pseudorandom numbers at a great rate, it may reduce contention for each thread to have its own pseudorandom-number generator.

					Returns ex -1. Note that for values of x near 0, the exact sum of expm1(x) + 1 is much closer to the true result of ex than exp(x). Special cases: If the argument is NaN, the result is NaN. If the argument is positive infinity, then the result is positive infinity. If the argument is negative infinity, then the result is -1.0. If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the same sign as the argument. The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result. Results must be semi-monotonic. The result of expm1 for any finite input must be greater than or equal to -1.0. Note that once the exact result of ex - 1 is within 1/2 ulp of the limit value -1, -1.0 should be returned.

					public static double log1p(double x)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the natural logarithm of the sum of the argument and 1. Note that for small values x, the result of log1p(x) is much closer to the true result of ln(1 + x) than the floating-point evaluation of log(1.0+x). Special cases: If the argument is NaN or less than -1, then the result is NaN. If the argument is positive infinity, then the result is positive infinity. If the argument is negative one, then the result is negative infinity. If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the same sign as the argument. The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result. Results must be semi-monotonic.

					public static double copySign(double magnitude,                double sign)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the first floating-point argument with the sign of the second floating-point argument. Note that unlike the StrictMath.copySign method, this method does not require NaN sign arguments to be treated as positive values; implementations are permitted to treat some NaN arguments as positive and other NaN arguments as negative to allow greater performance.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the unbiased exponent used in the representation of a float. Special cases: If the argument is NaN or infinite, then the result is Float.MAX_EXPONENT + 1. If the argument is zero or subnormal, then the result is Float.MIN_EXPONENT -1.

					public static double nextAfter(double start,                 double direction)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the floating-point number adjacent to the first argument in the direction of the second argument. If both arguments compare as equal the second argument is returned. Special cases: If either argument is a NaN, then NaN is returned. If both arguments are signed zeros, direction is returned unchanged (as implied by the requirement of returning the second argument if the arguments compare as equal). If start is ±Double.MIN_VALUE and direction has a value such that the result should have a smaller magnitude, then a zero with the same sign as start is returned. If start is infinite and direction has a value such that the result should have a smaller magnitude, Double.MAX_VALUE with the same sign as start is returned. If start is equal to ± Double.MAX_VALUE and direction has a value such that the result should have a larger magnitude, an infinity with same sign as start is returned.

If both arguments compare as equal a value equivalent to the second argument is returned. Special cases: If either argument is a NaN, then NaN is returned. If both arguments are signed zeros, a value equivalent to direction is returned. If start is ±Float.MIN_VALUE and direction has a value such that the result should have a smaller magnitude, then a zero with the same sign as start is returned.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the floating-point value adjacent to d in the direction of positive infinity. This method is semantically equivalent to nextAfter(d, Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY); however, a nextUp implementation may run faster than its equivalent nextAfter call. Special Cases: If the argument is NaN, the result is NaN. If the argument is positive infinity, the result is positive infinity. If the argument is zero, the result is Double.MIN_VALUE

					public static double scalb(double d,             int scaleFactor)
				</name>
				<description>
					Return d × 2scaleFactor rounded as if performed by a single correctly rounded floating-point multiply to a member of the double value set. See the Java Language Specification for a discussion of floating-point value sets. If the exponent of the result is between Double.MIN_EXPONENT and Double.MAX_EXPONENT, the answer is calculated exactly. If the exponent of the result would be larger than Double.MAX_EXPONENT, an infinity is returned. Note that if the result is subnormal, precision may be lost; that is, when scalb(x, n) is subnormal, scalb(scalb(x, n), -n) may not equal x. When the result is non-NaN, the result has the same sign as d. Special cases: If the first argument is NaN, NaN is returned. If the first argument is infinite, then an infinity of the same sign is returned. If the first argument is zero, then a zero of the same sign is returned.
