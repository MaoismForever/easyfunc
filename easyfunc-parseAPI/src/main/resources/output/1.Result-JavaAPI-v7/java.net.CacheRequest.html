			public abstract class CacheRequest  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			Represents channels for storing resources in the ResponseCache. Instances of such a class provide an OutputStream object which is called by protocol handlers to store the resource data into the cache, and also an abort() method which allows a cache store operation to be interrupted and abandoned. If an IOException is encountered while reading the response or writing to the cache, the current cache store operation will be aborted.
