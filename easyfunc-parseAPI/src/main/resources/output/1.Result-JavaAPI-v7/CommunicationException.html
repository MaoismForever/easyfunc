			public class CommunicationException  extends NamingException
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception is thrown when the client is unable to communicate with the directory or naming service. The inability to communicate with the service might be a result of many factors, such as network partitioning, hardware or interface problems, failures on either the client or server side. This exception is meant to be used to capture such communication problems. Synchronization and serialization issues that apply to NamingException apply directly here.
