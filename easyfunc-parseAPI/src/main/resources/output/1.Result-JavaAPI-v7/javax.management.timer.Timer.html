			public class Timer  extends NotificationBroadcasterSupport  implements TimerMBean, MBeanRegistration
		</name>
		<description>
			Provides the implementation of the timer MBean. The timer MBean sends out an alarm at a specified time that wakes up all the listeners registered to receive timer notifications. This class manages a list of dated timer notifications. A method allows users to add/remove as many notifications as required. When a timer notification is emitted by the timer and becomes obsolete, it is automatically removed from the list of timer notifications. Additional timer notifications can be added into regularly repeating notifications. Note: When sending timer notifications, the timer updates the notification sequence number irrespective of the notification type. The timer service relies on the system date of the host where the Timer class is loaded. Listeners may receive untimely notifications if their host has a different system date. To avoid such problems, synchronize the system date of all host machines where timing is needed. The default behavior for periodic notifications is fixed-delay execution, as specified in Timer. In order to use fixed-rate execution, use the overloaded addNotification(String, String, Object, Date, long, long, boolean) method. Notification listeners are potentially all executed in the same thread. Therefore, they should execute rapidly to avoid holding up other listeners or perturbing the regularity of fixed-delay executions. See NotificationBroadcasterSupport.

					Description copied from interface: NotificationBroadcaster Returns an array indicating, for each notification this MBean may send, the name of the Java class of the notification and the notification type. It is not illegal for the MBean to send notifications not described in this array. However, some clients of the MBean server may depend on the array being complete for their correct functioning.

If there is one or more timer notifications before the time in the list of notifications, the notification is sent according to the sendPastNotifications flag and then, updated according to its period and remaining number of occurrences. If the timer notification date remains earlier than the current date, this notification is just removed from the list of notifications.

				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a new timer notification with the specified type, message and userData and inserts it into the list of notifications with a given date, period and number of occurrences. If the timer notification to be inserted has a date that is before the current date, the method behaves as if the specified date were the current date. For once-off notifications, the notification is delivered immediately. For periodic notifications, the first notification is delivered immediately and the subsequent ones are spaced as specified by the period parameter. Note that once the timer notification has been added into the list of notifications, its associated date, period and number of occurrences cannot be updated. In the case of a periodic notification, the value of parameter fixedRate is used to specify the execution scheme, as specified in Timer.

				<description>
					Creates a new timer notification with the specified type, message and userData and inserts it into the list of notifications with a given date and period and a null number of occurrences. The timer notification will repeat continuously using the timer period using a fixed-delay execution scheme, as specified in Timer. In order to use a fixed-rate execution scheme, use addNotification(String, String, Object, Date, long, long, boolean) instead. If the timer notification to be inserted has a date that is before the current date, the method behaves as if the specified date were the current date.
