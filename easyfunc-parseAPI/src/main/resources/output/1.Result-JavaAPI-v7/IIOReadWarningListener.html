		</name>
		<description>
			An interface used by ImageReader implementations to notify callers of their image and thumbnail reading methods of warnings (non-fatal errors). Fatal errors cause the relevant read method to throw an IIOException. Localization is handled by associating a Locale with each IIOReadWarningListener as it is registered with an ImageReader. It is up to the ImageReader to provide localized messages.
