		</name>
		<description>
			A StreamPrintServiceFactory is the factory for StreamPrintService instances, which can print to an output stream in a particular document format described as a mime type. A typical output document format may be Postscript(TM). This class is implemented by a service and located by the implementation using the SPI JAR File specification. Applications locate instances of this class by calling the lookupStreamPrintServiceFactories(DocFlavor, String) method. Applications can use a StreamPrintService obtained from a factory in place of a PrintService which represents a physical printer device.

				<description>
					Locates factories for print services that can be used with a print job to output a stream of data in the format specified by outputMimeType. The outputMimeType parameter describes the document type that you want to create, whereas the flavor parameter describes the format in which the input data will be provided by the application to the StreamPrintService. Although null is an acceptable value to use in the lookup of stream printing services, it's typical to search for a particular desired format, such as Postscript(TM).

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a StreamPrintService that can print to the specified output stream. The output stream is created and managed by the application. It is the application's responsibility to close the stream and to ensure that this Printer is not reused. The application should not close this stream until any print job created from the printer is complete. Doing so earlier may generate a PrinterException and an event indicating that the job failed. Whereas a PrintService connected to a physical printer can be reused, a StreamPrintService connected to a stream cannot. The underlying StreamPrintService may be disposed by the print system with the dispose method before returning from the print method of DocPrintJob so that the print system knows this printer is no longer usable. This is equivalent to a physical printer going offline - permanently. Applications may supply a null print stream to create a queryable service. It is not valid to create a PrintJob for such a stream. Implementations which allocate resources on construction should examine the stream and may wish to only allocate resources if the stream is non-null.
