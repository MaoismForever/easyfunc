		<description>
			Converts an element (and its descendants) from/to DOM (or similar) representation. Implementations of this interface will be used in conjunction with XmlAnyElement annotation to map an element of XML into a representation of infoset such as W3C DOM. Implementations hide how a portion of XML is converted into/from such DOM-like representation, allowing JAXB providers to work with arbitrary such library. This interface is intended to be implemented by library writers and consumed by JAXB providers. None of those methods are intended to be called from applications.

				<description>
					When a JAXB provider needs to unmarshal a part of a document into an infoset representation, it first calls this method to create a Result object. A JAXB provider will then send a portion of the XML into the given result. Such a portion always form a subtree of the whole XML document rooted at an element.

				<description>
					Once the portion is sent to the Result. This method is called by a JAXB provider to obtain the unmarshalled element representation. Multiple invocations of this method may return different objects. This method can be invoked only when the whole sub-tree are fed to the Result object.

					Source marshal(ElementT n,               ValidationEventHandler errorHandler)
				</name>
				<description>
					This method is called when a JAXB provider needs to marshal an element to XML. If non-null, the returned Source must contain a whole document rooted at one element, which will then be weaved into a bigger document that the JAXB provider is marshalling.
