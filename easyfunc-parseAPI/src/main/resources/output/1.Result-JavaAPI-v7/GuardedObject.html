		<description>
			A GuardedObject is an object that is used to protect access to another object. A GuardedObject encapsulates a target object and a Guard object, such that access to the target object is possible only if the Guard object allows it. Once an object is encapsulated by a GuardedObject, access to that object is controlled by the getObject method, which invokes the checkGuard method on the Guard object that is guarding access. If access is not allowed, an exception is thrown.
