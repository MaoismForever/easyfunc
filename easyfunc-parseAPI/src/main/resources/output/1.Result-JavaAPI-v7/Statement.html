			public interface Statement  extends Wrapper, AutoCloseable
		</name>
		<description>
			The object used for executing a static SQL statement and returning the results it produces. By default, only one ResultSet object per Statement object can be open at the same time. Therefore, if the reading of one ResultSet object is interleaved with the reading of another, each must have been generated by different Statement objects. All execution methods in the Statement interface implicitly close a statment's current ResultSet object if an open one exists.

					ResultSet executeQuery(String sql)                         throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Executes the given SQL statement, which returns a single ResultSet object. Note:This method cannot be called on a PreparedStatement or CallableStatement.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					void close()             throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Releases this Statement object's database and JDBC resources immediately instead of waiting for this to happen when it is automatically closed. It is generally good practice to release resources as soon as you are finished with them to avoid tying up database resources. Calling the method close on a Statement object that is already closed has no effect. Note:When a Statement object is closed, its current ResultSet object, if one exists, is also closed.

					void setEscapeProcessing(boolean enable)                           throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets escape processing on or off. If escape scanning is on (the default), the driver will do escape substitution before sending the SQL statement to the database. Note: Since prepared statements have usually been parsed prior to making this call, disabling escape processing for PreparedStatements objects will have no effect.

			<method>
				<name>
					void setQueryTimeout(int seconds)                       throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the number of seconds the driver will wait for a Statement object to execute to the given number of seconds. By default there is no limit on the amount of time allowed for a running statement to complete. If the limit is exceeded, an SQLTimeoutException is thrown. A JDBC driver must apply this limit to the execute, executeQuery and executeUpdate methods. Note: JDBC driver implementations may also apply this limit to ResultSet methods (consult your driver vendor documentation for details). Note: In the case of Statement batching, it is implementation defined as to whether the time-out is applied to individual SQL commands added via the addBatch method or to the entire batch of SQL commands invoked by the executeBatch method (consult your driver vendor documentation for details).

			<method>
				<name>
					void cancel()              throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Cancels this Statement object if both the DBMS and driver support aborting an SQL statement. This method can be used by one thread to cancel a statement that is being executed by another thread.

			<method>
				<name>
					SQLWarning getWarnings()                         throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the first warning reported by calls on this Statement object. Subsequent Statement object warnings will be chained to this SQLWarning object. The warning chain is automatically cleared each time a statement is (re)executed. This method may not be called on a closed Statement object; doing so will cause an SQLException to be thrown. Note: If you are processing a ResultSet object, any warnings associated with reads on that ResultSet object will be chained on it rather than on the Statement object that produced it.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void clearWarnings()                     throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Clears all the warnings reported on this Statement object. After a call to this method, the method getWarnings will return null until a new warning is reported for this Statement object.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void setCursorName(String name)                     throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the SQL cursor name to the given String, which will be used by subsequent Statement object execute methods. This name can then be used in SQL positioned update or delete statements to identify the current row in the ResultSet object generated by this statement. If the database does not support positioned update/delete, this method is a noop. To insure that a cursor has the proper isolation level to support updates, the cursor's SELECT statement should have the form SELECT FOR UPDATE. If FOR UPDATE is not present, positioned updates may fail. Note: By definition, the execution of positioned updates and deletes must be done by a different Statement object than the one that generated the ResultSet object being used for positioning. Also, cursor names must be unique within a connection.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean execute(String sql)                  throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Executes the given SQL statement, which may return multiple results. In some (uncommon) situations, a single SQL statement may return multiple result sets and/or update counts. Normally you can ignore this unless you are (1) executing a stored procedure that you know may return multiple results or (2) you are dynamically executing an unknown SQL string. The execute method executes an SQL statement and indicates the form of the first result. You must then use the methods getResultSet or getUpdateCount to retrieve the result, and getMoreResults to move to any subsequent result(s). Note:This method cannot be called on a PreparedStatement or CallableStatement.

			<method>
				<name>
					void setFetchDirection(int direction)                         throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Gives the driver a hint as to the direction in which rows will be processed in ResultSet objects created using this Statement object. The default value is ResultSet.FETCH_FORWARD. Note that this method sets the default fetch direction for result sets generated by this Statement object. Each result set has its own methods for getting and setting its own fetch direction.
				</description>

					void addBatch(String sql)                throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the given SQL command to the current list of commmands for this Statement object. The commands in this list can be executed as a batch by calling the method executeBatch. Note:This method cannot be called on a PreparedStatement or CallableStatement.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int[] executeBatch()                     throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Submits a batch of commands to the database for execution and if all commands execute successfully, returns an array of update counts. The int elements of the array that is returned are ordered to correspond to the commands in the batch, which are ordered according to the order in which they were added to the batch. The elements in the array returned by the method executeBatch may be one of the following: A number greater than or equal to zero -- indicates that the command was processed successfully and is an update count giving the number of rows in the database that were affected by the command's execution A value of SUCCESS_NO_INFO -- indicates that the command was processed successfully but that the number of rows affected is unknown If one of the commands in a batch update fails to execute properly, this method throws a BatchUpdateException, and a JDBC driver may or may not continue to process the remaining commands in the batch. However, the driver's behavior must be consistent with a particular DBMS, either always continuing to process commands or never continuing to process commands. If the driver continues processing after a failure, the array returned by the method BatchUpdateException.getUpdateCounts will contain as many elements as there are commands in the batch, and at least one of the elements will be the following: A value of EXECUTE_FAILED -- indicates that the command failed to execute successfully and occurs only if a driver continues to process commands after a command fails The possible implementations and return values have been modified in the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.3 to accommodate the option of continuing to proccess commands in a batch update after a BatchUpdateException obejct has been thrown.
