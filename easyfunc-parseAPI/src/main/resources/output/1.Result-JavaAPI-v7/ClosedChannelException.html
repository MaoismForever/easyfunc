			public class ClosedChannelException  extends IOException
		</name>
		<description>
			Checked exception thrown when an attempt is made to invoke or complete an I/O operation upon channel that is closed, or at least closed to that operation. That this exception is thrown does not necessarily imply that the channel is completely closed. A socket channel whose write half has been shut down, for example, may still be open for reading.
