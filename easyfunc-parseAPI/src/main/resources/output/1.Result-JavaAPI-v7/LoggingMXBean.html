		<description>
			The management interface for the logging facility. It is recommended to use the PlatformLoggingMXBean management interface that implements all attributes defined in this LoggingMXBean. The ManagementFactory.getPlatformMXBean method can be used to obtain the PlatformLoggingMXBean object representing the management interface for logging. There is a single global instance of the LoggingMXBean. This instance is an MXBean that can be obtained by calling the LogManager.getLoggingMXBean() method or from the platform MBeanServer. The ObjectName that uniquely identifies the management interface for logging within the MBeanServer is:       java.util.logging:type=Logging   The instance registered in the platform MBeanServer is also a PlatformLoggingMXBean.

			<method>
				<name>
					List<String> getLoggerNames()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the list of currently registered logger names. This method calls LogManager.getLoggerNames() and returns a list of the logger names.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					String getLoggerLevel(String loggerName)
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the name of the log level associated with the specified logger. If the specified logger does not exist, null is returned. This method first finds the logger of the given name and then returns the name of the log level by calling: Logger.getLevel().getName(); If the Level of the specified logger is null, which means that this logger's effective level is inherited from its parent, an empty string will be returned.

			<method>
				<name>
					void setLoggerLevel(String loggerName,                    String levelName)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the specified logger to the specified new level. If the levelName is not null, the level of the specified logger is set to the parsed Level matching the levelName. If the levelName is null, the level of the specified logger is set to null and the effective level of the logger is inherited from its nearest ancestor with a specific (non-null) level value.

			<method>
				<name>
					String getParentLoggerName(String loggerName)
				</name>
				<description>
