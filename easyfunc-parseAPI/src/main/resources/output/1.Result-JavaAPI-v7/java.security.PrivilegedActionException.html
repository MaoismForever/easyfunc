			public class PrivilegedActionException  extends Exception
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception is thrown by doPrivileged(PrivilegedExceptionAction) and doPrivileged(PrivilegedExceptionAction, AccessControlContext context) to indicate that the action being performed threw a checked exception. The exception thrown by the action can be obtained by calling the getException method. In effect, an PrivilegedActionException is a "wrapper" for an exception thrown by a privileged action. As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism. The "exception thrown by the privileged computation" that is provided at construction time and accessed via the getException() method is now known as the cause, and may be accessed via the Throwable.getCause() method, as well as the aforementioned "legacy method."
