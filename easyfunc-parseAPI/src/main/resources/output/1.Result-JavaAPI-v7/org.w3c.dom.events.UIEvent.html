					The initUIEvent method is used to initialize the value of a UIEvent created through the DocumentEvent interface. This method may only be called before the UIEvent has been dispatched via the dispatchEvent method, though it may be called multiple times during that phase if necessary. If called multiple times, the final invocation takes precedence.
