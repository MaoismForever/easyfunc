			public abstract class Transformer  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			An instance of this abstract class can transform a source tree into a result tree. An instance of this class can be obtained with the TransformerFactory.newTransformer method. This instance may then be used to process XML from a variety of sources and write the transformation output to a variety of sinks. An object of this class may not be used in multiple threads running concurrently. Different Transformers may be used concurrently by different threads. A Transformer may be used multiple times. Parameters and output properties are preserved across transformations.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected Transformer()
				</name>
				<description>
					Default constructor is protected on purpose.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void reset()
				</name>
				<description>
					Reset this Transformer to its original configuration. Transformer is reset to the same state as when it was created with TransformerFactory.newTransformer(), TransformerFactory.newTransformer(Source source) or Templates.newTransformer(). reset() is designed to allow the reuse of existing Transformers thus saving resources associated with the creation of new Transformers. The reset Transformer is not guaranteed to have the same URIResolver or ErrorListener Objects, e.g. Object.equals(Object obj). It is guaranteed to have a functionally equal URIResolver and ErrorListener.

					public abstract void transform(Source xmlSource,               Result outputTarget)                          throws TransformerException
				</name>
				<description>
					Transform the XML Source to a Result. Specific transformation behavior is determined by the settings of the TransformerFactory in effect when the Transformer was instantiated and any modifications made to the Transformer instance. An empty Source is represented as an empty document as constructed by DocumentBuilder.newDocument(). The result of transforming an empty Source depends on the transformation behavior; it is not always an empty Result.

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void setParameter(String name,                  Object value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Add a parameter for the transformation. Pass a qualified name as a two-part string, the namespace URI enclosed in curly braces ({}), followed by the local name. If the name has a null URL, the String only contain the local name. An application can safely check for a non-null URI by testing to see if the first character of the name is a '{' character. For example, if a URI and local name were obtained from an element defined with <xyz:foo xmlns:xyz="http://xyz.foo.com/yada/baz.html"/>, then the qualified name would be "{http://xyz.foo.com/yada/baz.html}foo". Note that no prefix is used.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract Object getParameter(String name)
				</name>
				<description>
					Get a parameter that was explicitly set with setParameter. This method does not return a default parameter value, which cannot be determined until the node context is evaluated during the transformation process.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void clearParameters()
				</name>
				<description>
					Clear all parameters set with setParameter.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void setURIResolver(URIResolver resolver)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set an object that will be used to resolve URIs used in document(). If the resolver argument is null, the URIResolver value will be cleared and the transformer will no longer have a resolver.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract URIResolver getURIResolver()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get an object that will be used to resolve URIs used in document().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void setOutputProperties(Properties oformat)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the output properties for the transformation. These properties will override properties set in the Templates with xsl:output. If argument to this function is null, any properties previously set are removed, and the value will revert to the value defined in the templates object. Pass a qualified property key name as a two-part string, the namespace URI enclosed in curly braces ({}), followed by the local name. If the name has a null URL, the String only contain the local name. An application can safely check for a non-null URI by testing to see if the first character of the name is a '{' character. For example, if a URI and local name were obtained from an element defined with <xyz:foo xmlns:xyz="http://xyz.foo.com/yada/baz.html"/>, then the qualified name would be "{http://xyz.foo.com/yada/baz.html}foo". Note that no prefix is used. An IllegalArgumentException is thrown if any of the argument keys are not recognized and are not namespace qualified.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract Properties getOutputProperties()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get a copy of the output properties for the transformation. The properties returned should contain properties set by the user, and properties set by the stylesheet, and these properties are "defaulted" by default properties specified by section 16 of the XSL Transformations (XSLT) W3C Recommendation. The properties that were specifically set by the user or the stylesheet should be in the base Properties list, while the XSLT default properties that were not specifically set should be the default Properties list. Thus, getOutputProperties().getProperty(String key) will obtain any property in that was set by setOutputProperty(java.lang.String, java.lang.String), setOutputProperties(java.util.Properties), in the stylesheet, or the default properties, while getOutputProperties().get(String key) will only retrieve properties that were explicitly set by setOutputProperty(java.lang.String, java.lang.String), setOutputProperties(java.util.Properties), or in the stylesheet. Note that mutation of the Properties object returned will not effect the properties that the transformer contains. If any of the argument keys are not recognized and are not namespace qualified, the property will be ignored and not returned. In other words the behaviour is not orthogonal with setOutputProperties.

				</name>
				<description>
					Set an output property that will be in effect for the transformation. Pass a qualified property name as a two-part string, the namespace URI enclosed in curly braces ({}), followed by the local name. If the name has a null URL, the String only contain the local name. An application can safely check for a non-null URI by testing to see if the first character of the name is a '{' character. For example, if a URI and local name were obtained from an element defined with <xyz:foo xmlns:xyz="http://xyz.foo.com/yada/baz.html"/>, then the qualified name would be "{http://xyz.foo.com/yada/baz.html}foo". Note that no prefix is used. The Properties object that was passed to setOutputProperties(java.util.Properties) won't be effected by calling this method.

					public abstract String getOutputProperty(String name)                                    throws IllegalArgumentException
				</name>
				<description>
					Get an output property that is in effect for the transformer. If a property has been set using setOutputProperty(java.lang.String, java.lang.String), that value will be returned. Otherwise, if a property is explicitly specified in the stylesheet, that value will be returned. If the value of the property has been defaulted, that is, if no value has been set explicitly either with setOutputProperty(java.lang.String, java.lang.String) or in the stylesheet, the result may vary depending on implementation and input stylesheet.

					public abstract ErrorListener getErrorListener()
