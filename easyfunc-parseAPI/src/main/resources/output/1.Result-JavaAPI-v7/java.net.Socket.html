			public class Socket  extends Object  implements Closeable
		</name>
		<description>
			This class implements client sockets (also called just "sockets"). A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines. The actual work of the socket is performed by an instance of the SocketImpl class. An application, by changing the socket factory that creates the socket implementation, can configure itself to create sockets appropriate to the local firewall.

			<method>
				<name>
					public Socket()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates an unconnected socket, with the system-default type of SocketImpl.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Socket(Proxy proxy)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates an unconnected socket, specifying the type of proxy, if any, that should be used regardless of any other settings. If there is a security manager, its checkConnect method is called with the proxy host address and port number as its arguments. This could result in a SecurityException. Examples: Socket s = new Socket(Proxy.NO_PROXY); will create a plain socket ignoring any other proxy configuration. Socket s = new Socket(new Proxy(Proxy.Type.SOCKS, new InetSocketAddress("socks.mydom.com", 1080))); will create a socket connecting through the specified SOCKS proxy server.

					public Socket(String host,        int port)         throws UnknownHostException,                IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a stream socket and connects it to the specified port number on the named host. If the specified host is null it is the equivalent of specifying the address as InetAddress.getByName(null). In other words, it is equivalent to specifying an address of the loopback interface. If the application has specified a server socket factory, that factory's createSocketImpl method is called to create the actual socket implementation. Otherwise a "plain" socket is created. If there is a security manager, its checkConnect method is called with the host address and port as its arguments. This could result in a SecurityException.

				<description>
					Creates a socket and connects it to the specified remote host on the specified remote port. The Socket will also bind() to the local address and port supplied. If the specified host is null it is the equivalent of specifying the address as InetAddress.getByName(null). In other words, it is equivalent to specifying an address of the loopback interface. A local port number of zero will let the system pick up a free port in the bind operation. If there is a security manager, its checkConnect method is called with the host address and port as its arguments. This could result in a SecurityException.

					Creates a socket and connects it to the specified remote address on the specified remote port. The Socket will also bind() to the local address and port supplied. If the specified local address is null it is the equivalent of specifying the address as the AnyLocal address (see InetAddress.isAnyLocalAddress()). A local port number of zero will let the system pick up a free port in the bind operation.

					Deprecated. Use DatagramSocket instead for UDP transport. Creates a stream socket and connects it to the specified port number on the named host. If the specified host is null it is the equivalent of specifying the address as InetAddress.getByName(null). In other words, it is equivalent to specifying an address of the loopback interface. If the stream argument is true, this creates a stream socket. If the stream argument is false, it creates a datagram socket. If the application has specified a server socket factory, that factory's createSocketImpl method is called to create the actual socket implementation. Otherwise a "plain" socket is created. If there is a security manager, its checkConnect method is called with the host address and port as its arguments. This could result in a SecurityException. If a UDP socket is used, TCP/IP related socket options will not apply.

					public InputStream getInputStream()                             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an input stream for this socket. If this socket has an associated channel then the resulting input stream delegates all of its operations to the channel. If the channel is in non-blocking mode then the input stream's read operations will throw an IllegalBlockingModeException. Under abnormal conditions the underlying connection may be broken by the remote host or the network software (for example a connection reset in the case of TCP connections). When a broken connection is detected by the network software the following applies to the returned input stream :- The network software may discard bytes that are buffered by the socket. Bytes that aren't discarded by the network software can be read using read. If there are no bytes buffered on the socket, or all buffered bytes have been consumed by read, then all subsequent calls to read will throw an IOException. If there are no bytes buffered on the socket, and the socket has not been closed using close, then available will return 0. Closing the returned InputStream will close the associated socket.

					public void setOOBInline(boolean on)                    throws SocketException
				</name>
				<description>
					Enable/disable OOBINLINE (receipt of TCP urgent data) By default, this option is disabled and TCP urgent data received on a socket is silently discarded. If the user wishes to receive urgent data, then this option must be enabled. When enabled, urgent data is received inline with normal data. Note, only limited support is provided for handling incoming urgent data. In particular, no notification of incoming urgent data is provided and there is no capability to distinguish between normal data and urgent data unless provided by a higher level protocol.

					public void setSoTimeout(int timeout)                    throws SocketException
				</name>
				<description>
					Enable/disable SO_TIMEOUT with the specified timeout, in milliseconds. With this option set to a non-zero timeout, a read() call on the InputStream associated with this Socket will block for only this amount of time. If the timeout expires, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised, though the Socket is still valid. The option must be enabled prior to entering the blocking operation to have effect. The timeout must be > 0. A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout.

					public void setSendBufferSize(int size)                         throws SocketException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the SO_SNDBUF option to the specified value for this Socket. The SO_SNDBUF option is used by the platform's networking code as a hint for the size to set the underlying network I/O buffers. Because SO_SNDBUF is a hint, applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to should call getSendBufferSize().

					public void setReceiveBufferSize(int size)                            throws SocketException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the SO_RCVBUF option to the specified value for this Socket. The SO_RCVBUF option is used by the platform's networking code as a hint for the size to set the underlying network I/O buffers. Increasing the receive buffer size can increase the performance of network I/O for high-volume connection, while decreasing it can help reduce the backlog of incoming data. Because SO_RCVBUF is a hint, applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to should call getReceiveBufferSize(). The value of SO_RCVBUF is also used to set the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer. Generally, the window size can be modified at any time when a socket is connected. However, if a receive window larger than 64K is required then this must be requested before the socket is connected to the remote peer. There are two cases to be aware of: For sockets accepted from a ServerSocket, this must be done by calling ServerSocket.setReceiveBufferSize(int) before the ServerSocket is bound to a local address. For client sockets, setReceiveBufferSize() must be called before connecting the socket to its remote peer.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setTrafficClass(int tc)                       throws SocketException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets traffic class or type-of-service octet in the IP header for packets sent from this Socket. As the underlying network implementation may ignore this value applications should consider it a hint. The tc must be in the range 0 <= tc <= 255 or an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown. Notes: For Internet Protocol v4 the value consists of an integer, the least significant 8 bits of which represent the value of the TOS octet in IP packets sent by the socket. RFC 1349 defines the TOS values as follows: IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02) IPTOS_RELIABILITY (0x04) IPTOS_THROUGHPUT (0x08) IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10) The last low order bit is always ignored as this corresponds to the MBZ (must be zero) bit. Setting bits in the precedence field may result in a SocketException indicating that the operation is not permitted. As RFC 1122 section 4.2.4.2 indicates, a compliant TCP implementation should, but is not required to, let application change the TOS field during the lifetime of a connection. So whether the type-of-service field can be changed after the TCP connection has been established depends on the implementation in the underlying platform. Applications should not assume that they can change the TOS field after the connection. For Internet Protocol v6 tc is the value that would be placed into the sin6_flowinfo field of the IP header.

				<description>
					Gets traffic class or type-of-service in the IP header for packets sent from this Socket As the underlying network implementation may ignore the traffic class or type-of-service set using setTrafficClass(int) this method may return a different value than was previously set using the setTrafficClass(int) method on this Socket.

					public void setReuseAddress(boolean on)                       throws SocketException
				</name>
				<description>
					Enable/disable the SO_REUSEADDR socket option. When a TCP connection is closed the connection may remain in a timeout state for a period of time after the connection is closed (typically known as the TIME_WAIT state or 2MSL wait state). For applications using a well known socket address or port it may not be possible to bind a socket to the required SocketAddress if there is a connection in the timeout state involving the socket address or port. Enabling SO_REUSEADDR prior to binding the socket using bind(SocketAddress) allows the socket to be bound even though a previous connection is in a timeout state. When a Socket is created the initial setting of SO_REUSEADDR is disabled. The behaviour when SO_REUSEADDR is enabled or disabled after a socket is bound (See isBound()) is not defined.

					public void close()             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Closes this socket. Any thread currently blocked in an I/O operation upon this socket will throw a SocketException. Once a socket has been closed, it is not available for further networking use (i.e. can't be reconnected or rebound). A new socket needs to be created. Closing this socket will also close the socket's InputStream and OutputStream. If this socket has an associated channel then the channel is closed as well.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the client socket implementation factory for the application. The factory can be specified only once. When an application creates a new client socket, the socket implementation factory's createSocketImpl method is called to create the actual socket implementation. Passing null to the method is a no-op unless the factory was already set. If there is a security manager, this method first calls the security manager's checkSetFactory method to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result in a SecurityException.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets performance preferences for this socket. Sockets use the TCP/IP protocol by default. Some implementations may offer alternative protocols which have different performance characteristics than TCP/IP. This method allows the application to express its own preferences as to how these tradeoffs should be made when the implementation chooses from the available protocols. Performance preferences are described by three integers whose values indicate the relative importance of short connection time, low latency, and high bandwidth. The absolute values of the integers are irrelevant; in order to choose a protocol the values are simply compared, with larger values indicating stronger preferences. Negative values represent a lower priority than positive values. If the application prefers short connection time over both low latency and high bandwidth, for example, then it could invoke this method with the values (1, 0, 0). If the application prefers high bandwidth above low latency, and low latency above short connection time, then it could invoke this method with the values (0, 1, 2). Invoking this method after this socket has been connected will have no effect.
