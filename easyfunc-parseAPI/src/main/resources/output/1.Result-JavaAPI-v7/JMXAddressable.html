		<description>
			Implemented by objects that can have a JMXServiceURL address. All JMXConnectorServer objects implement this interface. Depending on the connector implementation, a JMXConnector object may implement this interface too. JMXConnector objects for the RMI Connector are instances of RMIConnector which implements this interface. An object implementing this interface might not have an address at a given moment. This is indicated by a null return value from getAddress().
