		<description>
			Each Document has a doctype attribute whose value is either null or a DocumentType object. The DocumentType interface in the DOM Core provides an interface to the list of entities that are defined for the document, and little else because the effect of namespaces and the various XML schema efforts on DTD representation are not clearly understood as of this writing. DOM Level 3 doesn't support editing DocumentType nodes. DocumentType nodes are read-only. See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification.

			<method>
				<name>
					String많etName()
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of DTD; i.e., the name immediately following the DOCTYPE keyword.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					NamedNodeMap많etEntities()
				</name>
				<description>
					A NamedNodeMap containing the general entities, both external and internal, declared in the DTD. Parameter entities are not contained. Duplicates are discarded. For example in: <!DOCTYPE   ex SYSTEM "ex.dtd" [ <!ENTITY foo "foo"> <!ENTITY bar   "bar"> <!ENTITY bar "bar2"> <!ENTITY % baz "baz">   ]> <ex/> the interface provides access to foo and the first declaration of bar but not the second declaration of bar or baz. Every node in this map also implements the Entity interface. The DOM Level 2 does not support editing entities, therefore entities cannot be altered in any way.

			<method>
				<name>
					NamedNodeMap많etNotations()
				</name>
				<description>
					A NamedNodeMap containing the notations declared in the DTD. Duplicates are discarded. Every node in this map also implements the Notation interface. The DOM Level 2 does not support editing notations, therefore notations cannot be altered in any way.

			<method>
				<name>
					String많etPublicId()
				</name>
				<description>
					The public identifier of the external subset.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					String많etSystemId()
				</name>
				<description>
					The system identifier of the external subset. This may be an absolute URI or not.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					String많etInternalSubset()
				</name>
				<description>
					The internal subset as a string, or null if there is none. This is does not contain the delimiting square brackets. Note: The actual content returned depends on how much information is available to the implementation. This may vary depending on various parameters, including the XML processor used to build the document.
