		<description>
			The AccessibleText interface should be implemented by all classes that present textual information on the display. This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to access that text via its content, attributes, and spatial location. Applications can determine if an object supports the AccessibleText interface by first obtaining its AccessibleContext (see Accessible) and then calling the AccessibleContext.getAccessibleText() method of AccessibleContext. If the return value is not null, the object supports this interface.
