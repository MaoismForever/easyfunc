		<description>
			Class JobImpressionsSupported is a printing attribute class, a set of integers, that gives the supported values for a JobImpressions attribute. It is restricted to a single contiguous range of integers; multiple non-overlapping ranges are not allowed. This gives the lower and upper bounds of the total sizes of print jobs in number of impressions that the printer will accept. IPP Compatibility: The JobImpressionsSupported attribute's canonical array form gives the lower and upper bound for the range of values to be included in an IPP "job-impressions-supported" attribute. See class SetOfIntegerSyntax for an explanation of canonical array form. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.

			<method>
				<name>
					public JobImpressionsSupported(int lowerBound,                         int upperBound)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a new job impressions supported attribute containing a single range of integers. That is, only those values of JobImpressions in the one range are supported.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean equals(Object object)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether this job impressions supported attribute is equivalent to the passed in object. To be equivalent, all of the following conditions must be true: object is not null. object is an instance of class JobImpressionsSupported. This job impressions supported attribute's members and object's members are the same.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final Class<? extends Attribute> getCategory()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the printing attribute class which is to be used as the "category" for this printing attribute value. For class JobImpressionsSupported, the category is class JobImpressionsSupported itself.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final String getName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the name of the category of which this attribute value is an instance. For class JobImpressionsSupported, the category name is "job-impressions-supported".
