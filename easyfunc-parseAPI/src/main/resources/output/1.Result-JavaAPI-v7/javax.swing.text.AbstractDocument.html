		</name>
		<description>
			An implementation of the document interface to serve as a basis for implementing various kinds of documents. At this level there is very little policy, so there is a corresponding increase in difficulty of use. This class implements a locking mechanism for the document. It allows multiple readers or one writer, and writers must wait until all observers of the document have been notified of a previous change before beginning another mutation to the document. The read lock is acquired and released using the render method. A write lock is aquired by the methods that mutate the document, and are held for the duration of the method call. Notification is done on the thread that produced the mutation, and the thread has full read access to the document for the duration of the notification, but other readers are kept out until the notification has finished. The notification is a beans event notification which does not allow any further mutations until all listeners have been notified. Any models subclassed from this class and used in conjunction with a text component that has a look and feel implementation that is derived from BasicTextUI may be safely updated asynchronously, because all access to the View hierarchy is serialized by BasicTextUI if the document is of type AbstractDocument. The locking assumes that an independent thread will access the View hierarchy only from the DocumentListener methods, and that there will be only one event thread active at a time. If concurrency support is desired, there are the following additional implications. The code path for any DocumentListener implementation and any UndoListener implementation must be threadsafe, and not access the component lock if trying to be safe from deadlocks. The repaint and revalidate methods on JComponent are safe. AbstractDocument models an implied break at the end of the document. Among other things this allows you to position the caret after the last character. As a result of this, getLength returns one less than the length of the Content. If you create your own Content, be sure and initialize it to have an additional character. Refer to StringContent and GapContent for examples of this. Another implication of this is that Elements that model the implied end character will have an endOffset == (getLength() + 1). For example, in DefaultStyledDocument getParagraphElement(getLength()).getEndOffset() == getLength() + 1 . Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void render(Runnable r)
				</name>
				<description>
					This allows the model to be safely rendered in the presence of currency, if the model supports being updated asynchronously. The given runnable will be executed in a way that allows it to safely read the model with no changes while the runnable is being executed. The runnable itself may not make any mutations. This is implemented to aquire a read lock for the duration of the runnables execution. There may be multiple runnables executing at the same time, and all writers will be blocked while there are active rendering runnables. If the runnable throws an exception, its lock will be safely released. There is no protection against a runnable that never exits, which will effectively leave the document locked for it's lifetime. If the given runnable attempts to make any mutations in this implementation, a deadlock will occur. There is no tracking of individual rendering threads to enable detecting this situation, but a subclass could incur the overhead of tracking them and throwing an error. This method is thread safe, although most Swing methods are not. Please see How to Use Threads for more information.

					public void insertString(int offs,                  String str,                  AttributeSet a)                    throws BadLocationException
				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts some content into the document. Inserting content causes a write lock to be held while the actual changes are taking place, followed by notification to the observers on the thread that grabbed the write lock. This method is thread safe, although most Swing methods are not. Please see How to Use Threads for more information.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getText(int offset,               int length)                 throws BadLocationException
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets a sequence of text from the document.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void getText(int offset,             int length,             Segment txt)               throws BadLocationException
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches the text contained within the given portion of the document. If the partialReturn property on the txt parameter is false, the data returned in the Segment will be the entire length requested and may or may not be a copy depending upon how the data was stored. If the partialReturn property is true, only the amount of text that can be returned without creating a copy is returned. Using partial returns will give better performance for situations where large parts of the document are being scanned. The following is an example of using the partial return to access the entire document:      int nleft = doc.getDocumentLength();     Segment text = new Segment();     int offs = 0;     text.setPartialReturn(true);     while (nleft > 0) {         doc.getText(offs, nleft, text);         // do something with text         nleft -= text.count;         offs += text.count;     }

					protected void insertUpdate(AbstractDocument.DefaultDocumentEvent chng,                  AttributeSet attr)
				</name>
				<description>
					Updates document structure as a result of text insertion. This will happen within a write lock. If a subclass of this class reimplements this method, it should delegate to the superclass as well.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void removeUpdate(AbstractDocument.DefaultDocumentEvent chng)
				</name>
				<description>
					Updates any document structure as a result of text removal. This method is called before the text is actually removed from the Content. This will happen within a write lock. If a subclass of this class reimplements this method, it should delegate to the superclass as well.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void postRemoveUpdate(AbstractDocument.DefaultDocumentEvent chng)
				</name>
				<description>
					Updates any document structure as a result of text removal. This method is called after the text has been removed from the Content. This will happen within a write lock. If a subclass of this class reimplements this method, it should delegate to the superclass as well.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void dump(PrintStream out)
				</name>
				<description>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected Element createLeafElement(Element parent,                          AttributeSet a,                          int p0,                          int p1)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a document leaf element. Hook through which elements are created to represent the document structure. Because this implementation keeps structure and content separate, elements grow automatically when content is extended so splits of existing elements follow. The document itself gets to decide how to generate elements to give flexibility in the type of elements used.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected Element createBranchElement(Element parent,                            AttributeSet a)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a document branch element, that can contain other elements.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected final Thread getCurrentWriter()
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches the current writing thread if there is one. This can be used to distinguish whether a method is being called as part of an existing modification or if a lock needs to be acquired and a new transaction started.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected final void writeLock()
				</name>
				<description>
					Acquires a lock to begin mutating the document this lock protects. There can be no writing, notification of changes, or reading going on in order to gain the lock. Additionally a thread is allowed to gain more than one writeLock, as long as it doesn't attempt to gain additional writeLocks from within document notification. Attempting to gain a writeLock from within a DocumentListener notification will result in an IllegalStateException. The ability to obtain more than one writeLock per thread allows subclasses to gain a writeLock, perform a number of operations, then release the lock. Calls to writeLock must be balanced with calls to writeUnlock, else the Document will be left in a locked state so that no reading or writing can be done.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected final void writeUnlock()
				</name>
				<description>
					Releases a write lock previously obtained via writeLock. After decrementing the lock count if there are no oustanding locks this will allow a new writer, or readers.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final void readLock()
				</name>
				<description>
					Acquires a lock to begin reading some state from the document. There can be multiple readers at the same time. Writing blocks the readers until notification of the change to the listeners has been completed. This method should be used very carefully to avoid unintended compromise of the document. It should always be balanced with a readUnlock.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final void readUnlock()
				</name>
				<description>
					Does a read unlock. This signals that one of the readers is done. If there are no more readers then writing can begin again. This should be balanced with a readLock, and should occur in a finally statement so that the balance is guaranteed. The following is an example.        readLock();       try {           // do something       } finally {           readUnlock();       }
