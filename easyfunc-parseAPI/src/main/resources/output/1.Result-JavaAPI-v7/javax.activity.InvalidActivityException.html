			public class InvalidActivityException  extends RemoteException
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception may be thrown on any method for which Activity context is accessed and indicates that the attempted invocation or the Activity context associated with the attempted invocation is incompatible with the Activity's current state. It may also be thrown by a container if Activity context is received on a method for which Activity context is forbidden. This exception will be propagated across J2EE Activity Service ORB boundaries via an org.omg.CORBA.INVALID_ACTIVITY system exception. An application should handle this error by attempting to complete the Activity.
