			public class StreamSource  extends Object  implements Source
		</name>
		<description>
			Acts as an holder for a transformation Source in the form of a stream of XML markup. Note: Due to their internal use of either a Reader or InputStream instance, StreamSource instances may only be used once.
		</description>
		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String FEATURE
				</name>
				<description>
					If TransformerFactory.getFeature(java.lang.String) returns true when passed this value as an argument, the Transformer supports Source input of this type.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StreamSource()
				</name>
				<description>
					Zero-argument default constructor. If this constructor is used, and no Stream source is set using setInputStream(java.io.InputStream inputStream) or setReader(java.io.Reader reader), then the Transformer will create an empty source InputStream using new InputStream().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StreamSource(InputStream inputStream)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a StreamSource from a byte stream. Normally, a stream should be used rather than a reader, so the XML parser can resolve character encoding specified by the XML declaration. If this constructor is used to process a stylesheet, normally setSystemId should also be called, so that relative URI references can be resolved.

				<name>
					public StreamSource(InputStream inputStream,              String systemId)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a StreamSource from a byte stream. Normally, a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that the XML parser can resolve character encoding specified by the XML declaration. This constructor allows the systemID to be set in addition to the input stream, which allows relative URIs to be processed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StreamSource(Reader reader)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a StreamSource from a character reader. Normally, a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that the XML parser can resolve character encoding specified by the XML declaration. However, in many cases the encoding of the input stream is already resolved, as in the case of reading XML from a StringReader.

				<description>
					Construct a StreamSource from a URL.

					public StreamSource(File f)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a StreamSource from a File.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setInputStream(InputStream inputStream)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the byte stream to be used as input. Normally, a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that the XML parser can resolve character encoding specified by the XML declaration. If this Source object is used to process a stylesheet, normally setSystemId should also be called, so that relative URL references can be resolved.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public InputStream getInputStream()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the byte stream that was set with setByteStream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setReader(Reader reader)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the input to be a character reader. Normally, a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that the XML parser can resolve character encoding specified by the XML declaration. However, in many cases the encoding of the input stream is already resolved, as in the case of reading XML from a StringReader.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Reader getReader()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the character stream that was set with setReader.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setPublicId(String publicId)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the public identifier for this Source. The public identifier is always optional: if the application writer includes one, it will be provided as part of the location information.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getPublicId()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the public identifier that was set with setPublicId.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setSystemId(String systemId)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the system identifier for this Source. The system identifier is optional if there is a byte stream or a character stream, but it is still useful to provide one, since the application can use it to resolve relative URIs and can include it in error messages and warnings (the parser will attempt to open a connection to the URI only if there is no byte stream or character stream specified).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getSystemId()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setSystemId(File f)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the system ID from a File reference.
