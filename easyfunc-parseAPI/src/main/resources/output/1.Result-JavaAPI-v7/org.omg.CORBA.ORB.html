			public abstract class ORB  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			A class providing APIs for the CORBA Object Request Broker features. The ORB class also provides "pluggable ORB implementation" APIs that allow another vendor's ORB implementation to be used. An ORB makes it possible for CORBA objects to communicate with each other by connecting objects making requests (clients) with objects servicing requests (servers). The ORB class, which encapsulates generic CORBA functionality, does the following: (Note that items 5 and 6, which include most of the methods in the class ORB, are typically used with the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII) and the Dynamic Skeleton Interface (DSI). These interfaces may be used by a developer directly, but most commonly they are used by the ORB internally and are not seen by the general programmer.) initializes the ORB implementation by supplying values for predefined properties and environmental parameters obtains initial object references to services such as the NameService using the method resolve_initial_references converts object references to strings and back connects the ORB to a servant (an instance of a CORBA object implementation) and disconnects the ORB from a servant creates objects such as TypeCode Any NamedValue Context Environment lists (such as NVList) containing these objects sends multiple messages in the DII The ORB class can be used to obtain references to objects implemented anywhere on the network. An application or applet gains access to the CORBA environment by initializing itself into an ORB using one of three init methods. Two of the three methods use the properties (associations of a name with a value) shown in the table below. Property Name Property Value Standard Java CORBA Properties: org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass class name of an ORB implementation org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass class name of the ORB returned by init() These properties allow a different vendor's ORB implementation to be "plugged in." When an ORB instance is being created, the class name of the ORB implementation is located using the following standard search order: check in Applet parameter or application string array, if any check in properties parameter, if any check in the System properties check in the orb.properties file located in the user.home directory (if any) check in the orb.properties file located in the java.home/lib directory (if any) fall back on a hardcoded default behavior (use the Java IDL implementation) Note that Java IDL provides a default implementation for the fully-functional ORB and for the Singleton ORB. When the method init is given no parameters, the default Singleton ORB is returned. When the method init is given parameters but no ORB class is specified, the Java IDL ORB implementation is returned. The following code fragment creates an ORB object initialized with the default ORB Singleton. This ORB has a restricted implementation to prevent malicious applets from doing anything beyond creating typecodes. It is called a singleton because there is only one instance for an entire virtual machine.       ORB orb = ORB.init();   The following code fragment creates an ORB object for an application. The parameter args represents the arguments supplied to the application's main method. Since the property specifies the ORB class to be "SomeORBImplementation", the new ORB will be initialized with that ORB implementation. If p had been null, and the arguments had not specified an ORB class, the new ORB would have been initialized with the default Java IDL implementation.       Properties p = new Properties();      p.put("org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass", "SomeORBImplementation");      ORB orb = ORB.init(args, p);   The following code fragment creates an ORB object for the applet supplied as the first parameter. If the given applet does not specify an ORB class, the new ORB will be initialized with the default Java IDL implementation.       ORB orb = ORB.init(myApplet, null);   An application or applet can be initialized in one or more ORBs. ORB initialization is a bootstrap call into the CORBA world.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static ORB init()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the ORB singleton object. This method always returns the same ORB instance, which is an instance of the class described by the org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass system property. This no-argument version of the method init is used primarily as a factory for TypeCode objects, which are used by Helper classes to implement the method type. It is also used to create Any objects that are used to describe union labels (as part of creating a TypeCode object for a union). This method is not intended to be used by applets, and in the event that it is called in an applet environment, the ORB it returns is restricted so that it can be used only as a factory for TypeCode objects. Any TypeCode objects it produces can be safely shared among untrusted applets. If an ORB is created using this method from an applet, a system exception will be thrown if methods other than those for creating TypeCode objects are invoked.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void connect(Object obj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Connects the given servant object (a Java object that is an instance of the server implementation class) to the ORB. The servant class must extend the ImplBase class corresponding to the interface that is supported by the server. The servant must thus be a CORBA object reference, and inherit from org.omg.CORBA.Object. Servants created by the user can start receiving remote invocations after the method connect has been called. A servant may also be automatically and implicitly connected to the ORB if it is passed as an IDL parameter in an IDL method invocation on a non-local object, that is, if the servant object has to be marshalled and sent outside of the process address space. Calling the method connect has no effect when the servant object is already connected to the ORB. Deprecated by the OMG in favor of the Portable Object Adapter APIs.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void destroy()
				</name>
				<description>
					Destroys the ORB so that its resources can be reclaimed. Any operation invoked on a destroyed ORB reference will throw the OBJECT_NOT_EXIST exception. Once an ORB has been destroyed, another call to init with the same ORBid will return a reference to a newly constructed ORB. If destroy is called on an ORB that has not been shut down, it will start the shut down process and block until the ORB has shut down before it destroys the ORB. If an application calls destroy in a thread that is currently servicing an invocation, the BAD_INV_ORDER system exception will be thrown with the OMG minor code 3, since blocking would result in a deadlock. For maximum portability and to avoid resource leaks, an application should always call shutdown and destroy on all ORB instances before exiting.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void disconnect(Object obj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Disconnects the given servant object from the ORB. After this method returns, the ORB will reject incoming remote requests for the disconnected servant and will send the exception org.omg.CORBA.OBJECT_NOT_EXIST back to the remote client. Thus the object appears to be destroyed from the point of view of remote clients. Note, however, that local requests issued using the servant directly do not pass through the ORB; hence, they will continue to be processed by the servant. Calling the method disconnect has no effect if the servant is not connected to the ORB. Deprecated by the OMG in favor of the Portable Object Adapter APIs.

				<name>
					public TypeCode create_recursive_tc(String id)
				</name>
				<description>
					Create a recursive TypeCode object which serves as a placeholder for a concrete TypeCode during the process of creating TypeCodes which contain recursion. The id parameter specifies the repository id of the type for which the recursive TypeCode is serving as a placeholder. Once the recursive TypeCode has been properly embedded in the enclosing TypeCode which corresponds to the specified repository id, it will function as a normal TypeCode. Invoking operations on the recursive TypeCode before it has been embedded in the enclosing TypeCode will result in a BAD_TYPECODE exception. For example, the following IDL type declaration contains recursion:       Struct Node {          Sequence<Node> subnodes;      };   To create a TypeCode for struct Node, you would invoke the TypeCode creation operations as shown below:    String nodeID = "IDL:Node:1.0";   TypeCode recursiveSeqTC = orb.create_sequence_tc(0, orb.create_recursive_tc(nodeID));   StructMember[] members = { new StructMember("subnodes", recursiveSeqTC, null) };   TypeCode structNodeTC = orb.create_struct_tc(nodeID, "Node", members);   Also note that the following is an illegal IDL type declaration:       Struct Node {          Node next;      };   Recursive types can only appear within sequences which can be empty. That way marshaling problems, when transmitting the struct in an Any, are avoided.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void shutdown(boolean wait_for_completion)
				</name>
				<description>
					Instructs the ORB to shut down, which causes all object adapters to shut down, in preparation for destruction. If the wait_for_completion parameter is true, this operation blocks until all ORB processing (including processing of currently executing requests, object deactivation, and other object adapter operations) has completed. If an application does this in a thread that is currently servicing an invocation, the BAD_INV_ORDER system exception will be thrown with the OMG minor code 3, since blocking would result in a deadlock. If the wait_for_completion parameter is FALSE, then shutdown may not have completed upon return. While the ORB is in the process of shutting down, the ORB operates as normal, servicing incoming and outgoing requests until all requests have been completed. Once an ORB has shutdown, only object reference management operations may be invoked on the ORB or any object reference obtained from it. An application may also invoke the destroy operation on the ORB itself. Invoking any other operation will throw the BAD_INV_ORDER system exception with the OMG minor code 4. The ORB.run method will return after shutdown has been called.

					Used to obtain information about CORBA facilities and services that are supported by this ORB. The service type for which information is being requested is passed in as the in parameter service_type, the values defined by constants in the CORBA module. If service information is available for that type, that is returned in the out parameter service_info, and the operation returns the value true. If no information for the requested services type is available, the operation returns false (i.e., the service is not supported by this ORB).
