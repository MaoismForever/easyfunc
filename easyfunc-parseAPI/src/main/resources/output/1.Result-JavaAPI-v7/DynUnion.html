		<description>
			DynUnion objects support the manipulation of IDL unions. A union can have only two valid current positions: zero, which denotes the discriminator one, which denotes the active member The component_count value for a union depends on the current discriminator: it is 2 for a union whose discriminator indicates a named member, and 1 otherwise.
