		<description>
			This interface represents an "intermediate context" for name resolution. The Resolver interface contains methods that are implemented by contexts that do not support subtypes of Context, but which can act as intermediate contexts for resolution purposes. A Name parameter passed to any method is owned by the caller. The service provider will not modify the object or keep a reference to it. A ResolveResult object returned by any method is owned by the caller. The caller may subsequently modify it; the service provider may not.
