		<description>
			A static class for creating SASL clients and servers. This class defines the policy of how to locate, load, and instantiate SASL clients and servers. For example, an application or library gets a SASL client by doing something like:    SaslClient sc = Sasl.createSaslClient(mechanisms,       authorizationId, protocol, serverName, props, callbackHandler);   It can then proceed to use the instance to create an authentication connection. Similarly, a server gets a SASL server by using code that looks as follows:    SaslServer ss = Sasl.createSaslServer(mechanism,       protocol, serverName, props, callbackHandler);

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String QOP
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of a property that specifies the quality-of-protection to use. The property contains a comma-separated, ordered list of quality-of-protection values that the client or server is willing to support. A qop value is one of "auth" - authentication only "auth-int" - authentication plus integrity protection "auth-conf" - authentication plus integrity and confidentiality protection The order of the list specifies the preference order of the client or server. If this property is absent, the default qop is "auth". The value of this constant is "javax.security.sasl.qop".

					public static final String STRENGTH
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of a property that specifies the cipher strength to use. The property contains a comma-separated, ordered list of cipher strength values that the client or server is willing to support. A strength value is one of "low" "medium" "high" The order of the list specifies the preference order of the client or server. An implementation should allow configuration of the meaning of these values. An application may use the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) with JCE-aware mechanisms to control the selection of cipher suites that match the strength values. If this property is absent, the default strength is "high,medium,low". The value of this constant is "javax.security.sasl.strength".

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String SERVER_AUTH
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of a property that specifies whether the server must authenticate to the client. The property contains "true" if the server must authenticate the to client; "false" otherwise. The default is "false". The value of this constant is "javax.security.sasl.server.authentication".
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String MAX_BUFFER
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of a property that specifies the maximum size of the receive buffer in bytes of SaslClient/SaslServer. The property contains the string representation of an integer. If this property is absent, the default size is defined by the mechanism. The value of this constant is "javax.security.sasl.maxbuffer".
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String RAW_SEND_SIZE
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of a property that specifies the maximum size of the raw send buffer in bytes of SaslClient/SaslServer. The property contains the string representation of an integer. The value of this property is negotiated between the client and server during the authentication exchange. The value of this constant is "javax.security.sasl.rawsendsize".

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String REUSE
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of a property that specifies whether to reuse previously authenticated session information. The property contains "true" if the mechanism implementation may attempt to reuse previously authenticated session information; it contains "false" if the implementation must not reuse previously authenticated session information. A setting of "true" serves only as a hint: it does not necessarily entail actual reuse because reuse might not be possible due to a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, lack of mechanism support for reuse, expiration of reusable information, and the peer's refusal to support reuse. The property's default value is "false". The value of this constant is "javax.security.sasl.reuse". Note that all other parameters and properties required to create a SASL client/server instance must be provided regardless of whether this property has been supplied. That is, you cannot supply any less information in anticipation of reuse. Mechanism implementations that support reuse might allow customization of its implementation, for factors such as cache size, timeouts, and criteria for reuseability. Such customizations are implementation-dependent.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String POLICY_NODICTIONARY
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of a property that specifies whether mechanisms susceptible to passive dictionary attacks are not permitted.

					public static final String POLICY_NOANONYMOUS
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of a property that specifies whether mechanisms that accept anonymous login are not permitted. The property contains "true" if mechanisms that accept anonymous login are not permitted; "false" if such mechanisms are permitted. The default is "false". The value of this constant is "javax.security.sasl.policy.noanonymous".

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String POLICY_FORWARD_SECRECY
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of a property that specifies whether mechanisms that implement forward secrecy between sessions are required. Forward secrecy means that breaking into one session will not automatically provide information for breaking into future sessions. The property contains "true" if mechanisms that implement forward secrecy between sessions are required; "false" if such mechanisms are not required. The default is "false". The value of this constant is "javax.security.sasl.policy.forward".

					public static SaslClient createSaslClient(String[] mechanisms,                            String authorizationId,                            String protocol,                            String serverName,                            Map<String,?> props,                            CallbackHandler cbh)                                     throws SaslException
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a SaslClient using the parameters supplied. This method uses the JCA Security Provider Framework, described in the "Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference", for locating and selecting a SaslClient implementation. First, it obtains an ordered list of SaslClientFactory instances from the registered security providers for the "SaslClientFactory" service and the specified SASL mechanism(s). It then invokes createSaslClient() on each factory instance on the list until one produces a non-null SaslClient instance. It returns the non-null SaslClient instance, or null if the search fails to produce a non-null SaslClient instance. A security provider for SaslClientFactory registers with the JCA Security Provider Framework keys of the form SaslClientFactory.mechanism_name and values that are class names of implementations of javax.security.sasl.SaslClientFactory. For example, a provider that contains a factory class, com.wiz.sasl.digest.ClientFactory, that supports the "DIGEST-MD5" mechanism would register the following entry with the JCA: SaslClientFactory.DIGEST-MD5 com.wiz.sasl.digest.ClientFactory See the "Java Cryptography Architecture API Specification & Reference" for information about how to install and configure security service providers.
