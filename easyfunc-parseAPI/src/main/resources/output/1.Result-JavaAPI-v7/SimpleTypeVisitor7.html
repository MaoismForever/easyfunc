			@SupportedSourceVersion(value=RELEASE_7)  public class SimpleTypeVisitor7<R,P>  extends SimpleTypeVisitor6<R,P>
		</name>
		<description>
			A simple visitor of types with default behavior appropriate for the RELEASE_7 source version. Visit methods corresponding to RELEASE_7 and earlier language constructs call defaultAction, passing their arguments to defaultAction's corresponding parameters. Methods in this class may be overridden subject to their general contract. Note that annotating methods in concrete subclasses with @Override will help ensure that methods are overridden as intended. WARNING: The TypeVisitor interface implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to future versions of the Java™ programming language. Therefore, methods whose names begin with "visit" may be added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities, classes which extend this class should not declare any instance methods with names beginning with "visit". When such a new visit method is added, the default implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method. A new simple type visitor class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the visit method in question. When the new visitor is introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
