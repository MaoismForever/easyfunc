		<description>
			A class that describes the pointer position. It provides the GraphicsDevice where the pointer is and the Point that represents the coordinates of the pointer. Instances of this class should be obtained via MouseInfo.getPointerInfo(). The PointerInfo instance is not updated dynamically as the mouse moves. To get the updated location, you must call MouseInfo.getPointerInfo() again.
