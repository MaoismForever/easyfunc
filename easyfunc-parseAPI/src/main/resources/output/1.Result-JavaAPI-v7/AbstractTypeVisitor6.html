			public abstract class AbstractTypeVisitor6<R,P>  extends Object  implements TypeVisitor<R,P>
		</name>
		<description>
			A skeletal visitor of types with default behavior appropriate for the RELEASE_6 source version. WARNING: The TypeVisitor interface implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to future versions of the Java™ programming language. Therefore, methods whose names begin with "visit" may be added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities, classes which extend this class should not declare any instance methods with names beginning with "visit". When such a new visit method is added, the default implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method. A new abstract type visitor class will also be introduced to correspond to the new language level; this visitor will have different default behavior for the visit method in question. When the new visitor is introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected AbstractTypeVisitor6()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructor for concrete subclasses to call.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final R visit(TypeMirror t,        P p)
				</name>
				<description>
					Visits any type mirror as if by passing itself to that type mirror's accept method. The invocation v.visit(t, p) is equivalent to t.accept(v, p).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final R visit(TypeMirror t)
				</name>
				<description>
					Visits any type mirror as if by passing itself to that type mirror's accept method and passing null for the additional parameter. The invocation v.visit(t) is equivalent to t.accept(v, null).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public R visitUnion(UnionType t,             P p)
				</name>
				<description>
					Visits a UnionType element by calling visitUnknown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public R visitUnknown(TypeMirror t,               P p)
				</name>
				<description>
					Visits an unknown kind of type. This can occur if the language evolves and new kinds of types are added to the TypeMirror hierarchy. The default implementation of this method in AbstractTypeVisitor6 will always throw UnknownTypeException. This behavior is not required of a subclass.
