			public static enum LayoutStyle.ComponentPlacement  extends Enum<LayoutStyle.ComponentPlacement>

		<description>
			ComponentPlacement is an enumeration of the possible ways two components can be placed relative to each other. ComponentPlacement is used by the LayoutStyle method getPreferredGap. Refer to LayoutStyle for more information.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final LayoutStyle.ComponentPlacement RELATED
				</name>
				<description>
					Enumeration value indicating the two components are visually related and will be placed in the same parent. For example, a JLabel providing a label for a JTextField is typically visually associated with the JTextField; the constant RELATED is used for this.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final LayoutStyle.ComponentPlacement UNRELATED
				</name>
				<description>
					Enumeration value indicating the two components are visually unrelated and will be placed in the same parent. For example, groupings of components are usually visually separated; the constant UNRELATED is used for this.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final LayoutStyle.ComponentPlacement INDENT
				</name>
				<description>
					Enumeration value indicating the distance to indent a component is being requested. For example, often times the children of a label will be horizontally indented from the label. To determine the preferred distance for such a gap use the INDENT type. This value is typically only useful with a direction of EAST or WEST.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static LayoutStyle.ComponentPlacement[] values()
				</name>
				<description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static LayoutStyle.ComponentPlacement valueOf(String name)
				</name>
