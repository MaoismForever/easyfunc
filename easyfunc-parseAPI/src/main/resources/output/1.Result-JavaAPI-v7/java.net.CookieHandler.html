		<description>
			A CookieHandler object provides a callback mechanism to hook up a HTTP state management policy implementation into the HTTP protocol handler. The HTTP state management mechanism specifies a way to create a stateful session with HTTP requests and responses. A system-wide CookieHandler that to used by the HTTP protocol handler can be registered by doing a CookieHandler.setDefault(CookieHandler). The currently registered CookieHandler can be retrieved by calling CookieHandler.getDefault(). For more information on HTTP state management, see RFC 2965: HTTP State Management Mechanism

				</name>
				<description>
					Gets all the applicable cookies from a cookie cache for the specified uri in the request header. The URI passed as an argument specifies the intended use for the cookies. In particular the scheme should reflect whether the cookies will be sent over http, https or used in another context like javascript. The host part should reflect either the destination of the cookies or their origin in the case of javascript. It is up to the implementation to take into account the URI and the cookies attributes and security settings to determine which ones should be returned. HTTP protocol implementers should make sure that this method is called after all request headers related to choosing cookies are added, and before the request is sent.
