		<description>
			Enables policy types to be constructed using CORBA.ORB.create_policy. A portable ORB service implementation registers an instance of the PolicyFactory interface during ORB initialization in order to enable its policy types to be constructed using CORBA.ORB.create_policy. The POA is required to preserve any policy which is registered with ORBInitInfo in this manner.
