		<description>
			JavaBeans components that are Activation Framework aware implement this interface to find out which command verb they're being asked to perform, and to obtain the DataHandler representing the data they should operate on. JavaBeans that don't implement this interface may be used as well. Such commands may obtain the data using the Externalizable interface, or using an application-specific method.
