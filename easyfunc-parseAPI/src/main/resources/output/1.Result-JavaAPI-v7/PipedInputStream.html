		<description>
			A piped input stream should be connected to a piped output stream; the piped input stream then provides whatever data bytes are written to the piped output stream. Typically, data is read from a PipedInputStream object by one thread and data is written to the corresponding PipedOutputStream by some other thread. Attempting to use both objects from a single thread is not recommended, as it may deadlock the thread. The piped input stream contains a buffer, decoupling read operations from write operations, within limits. A pipe is said to be broken if a thread that was providing data bytes to the connected piped output stream is no longer alive.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected static final int PIPE_SIZE
				</name>
				<description>
					The default size of the pipe's circular input buffer.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected byte[] buffer
				</name>
				<description>
					The circular buffer into which incoming data is placed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected int in
				</name>
				<description>
					The index of the position in the circular buffer at which the next byte of data will be stored when received from the connected piped output stream. in<0 implies the buffer is empty, in==out implies the buffer is full
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					protected int out
				</name>
				<description>
					The index of the position in the circular buffer at which the next byte of data will be read by this piped input stream.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public PipedInputStream(PipedOutputStream src)                   throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a PipedInputStream so that it is connected to the piped output stream src. Data bytes written to src will then be available as input from this stream.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public PipedInputStream(PipedOutputStream src,                  int pipeSize)                   throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a PipedInputStream so that it is connected to the piped output stream src and uses the specified pipe size for the pipe's buffer. Data bytes written to src will then be available as input from this stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public PipedInputStream()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a PipedInputStream so that it is not yet connected. It must be connected to a PipedOutputStream before being used.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public PipedInputStream(int pipeSize)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a PipedInputStream so that it is not yet connected and uses the specified pipe size for the pipe's buffer. It must be connected to a PipedOutputStream before being used.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void connect(PipedOutputStream src)               throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Causes this piped input stream to be connected to the piped output stream src. If this object is already connected to some other piped output stream, an IOException is thrown. If src is an unconnected piped output stream and snk is an unconnected piped input stream, they may be connected by either the call: snk.connect(src) or the call: src.connect(snk) The two calls have the same effect.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void receive(int b)                  throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Receives a byte of data. This method will block if no input is available.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int read()           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads the next byte of data from this piped input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. This method blocks until input data is available, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int read(byte[] b,         int off,         int len)           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads up to len bytes of data from this piped input stream into an array of bytes. Less than len bytes will be read if the end of the data stream is reached or if len exceeds the pipe's buffer size. If len is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, the method blocks until at least 1 byte of input is available, end of the stream has been detected, or an exception is thrown.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int available()                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of bytes that can be read from this input stream without blocking.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void close()             throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Closes this piped input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream.
