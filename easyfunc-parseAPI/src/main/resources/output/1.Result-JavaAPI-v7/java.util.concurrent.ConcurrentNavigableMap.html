			public interface ConcurrentNavigableMap<K,V>  extends ConcurrentMap<K,V>, NavigableMap<K,V>
		</name>
		<description>
			A ConcurrentMap supporting NavigableMap operations, and recursively so for its navigable sub-maps. This interface is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

					ConcurrentNavigableMap<K,V> subMap(K fromKey,                                   boolean fromInclusive,                                   K toKey,                                   boolean toInclusive)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: NavigableMap Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys range from fromKey to toKey. If fromKey and toKey are equal, the returned map is empty unless fromInclusive and toInclusive are both true. The returned map is backed by this map, so changes in the returned map are reflected in this map, and vice-versa. The returned map supports all optional map operations that this map supports. The returned map will throw an IllegalArgumentException on an attempt to insert a key outside of its range, or to construct a submap either of whose endpoints lie outside its range.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: NavigableMap Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are less than (or equal to, if inclusive is true) toKey. The returned map is backed by this map, so changes in the returned map are reflected in this map, and vice-versa. The returned map supports all optional map operations that this map supports. The returned map will throw an IllegalArgumentException on an attempt to insert a key outside its range.

					Description copied from interface: NavigableMap Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are greater than (or equal to, if inclusive is true) fromKey. The returned map is backed by this map, so changes in the returned map are reflected in this map, and vice-versa. The returned map supports all optional map operations that this map supports.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: NavigableMap Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys range from fromKey, inclusive, to toKey, exclusive. (If fromKey and toKey are equal, the returned map is empty.) The returned map is backed by this map, so changes in the returned map are reflected in this map, and vice-versa. The returned map supports all optional map operations that this map supports. The returned map will throw an IllegalArgumentException on an attempt to insert a key outside its range. Equivalent to subMap(fromKey, true, toKey, false).

			<method>
				<name>
					ConcurrentNavigableMap<K,V> headMap(K toKey)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: NavigableMap Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are strictly less than toKey. The returned map is backed by this map, so changes in the returned map are reflected in this map, and vice-versa. The returned map supports all optional map operations that this map supports. The returned map will throw an IllegalArgumentException on an attempt to insert a key outside its range. Equivalent to headMap(toKey, false).

					ConcurrentNavigableMap<K,V> tailMap(K fromKey)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: NavigableMap Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are greater than or equal to fromKey. The returned map is backed by this map, so changes in the returned map are reflected in this map, and vice-versa. The returned map supports all optional map operations that this map supports. The returned map will throw an IllegalArgumentException on an attempt to insert a key outside its range. Equivalent to tailMap(fromKey, true).

			<method>
				<name>
					ConcurrentNavigableMap<K,V> descendingMap()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a reverse order view of the mappings contained in this map. The descending map is backed by this map, so changes to the map are reflected in the descending map, and vice-versa. The returned map has an ordering equivalent to Collections.reverseOrder(comparator()). The expression m.descendingMap().descendingMap() returns a view of m essentially equivalent to m.

				<name>
					NavigableSet<K> navigableKeySet()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a NavigableSet view of the keys contained in this map. The set's iterator returns the keys in ascending order. The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll, retainAll, and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations. The view's iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will never throw ConcurrentModificationException, and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction.

				<description>
					Returns a NavigableSet view of the keys contained in this map. The set's iterator returns the keys in ascending order. The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll, retainAll, and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations. The view's iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will never throw ConcurrentModificationException, and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction. This method is equivalent to method navigableKeySet.
