		</name>
		<description>
			A scalable concurrent ConcurrentNavigableMap implementation. The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This class implements a concurrent variant of SkipLists providing expected average log(n) time cost for the containsKey, get, put and remove operations and their variants. Insertion, removal, update, and access operations safely execute concurrently by multiple threads. Iterators are weakly consistent, returning elements reflecting the state of the map at some point at or since the creation of the iterator. They do not throw ConcurrentModificationException, and may proceed concurrently with other operations. Ascending key ordered views and their iterators are faster than descending ones. All Map.Entry pairs returned by methods in this class and its views represent snapshots of mappings at the time they were produced. They do not support the Entry.setValue method. (Note however that it is possible to change mappings in the associated map using put, putIfAbsent, or replace, depending on exactly which effect you need.) Beware that, unlike in most collections, the size method is not a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these maps, determining the current number of elements requires a traversal of the elements, and so may report inaccurate results if this collection is modified during traversal. Additionally, the bulk operations putAll, equals, toArray, containsValue, and clear are not guaranteed to be performed atomically. For example, an iterator operating concurrently with a putAll operation might view only some of the added elements. This class and its views and iterators implement all of the optional methods of the Map and Iterator interfaces. Like most other concurrent collections, this class does not permit the use of null keys or values because some null return values cannot be reliably distinguished from the absence of elements. This class is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new map containing the same mappings and using the same ordering as the specified sorted map.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public ConcurrentSkipListMap<K,V> clone()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a shallow copy of this ConcurrentSkipListMap instance. (The keys and values themselves are not cloned.)
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean containsKey(Object key)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this map contains a mapping for the specified key.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public V get(Object key)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key. More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key k to a value v such that key compares equal to k according to the map's ordering, then this method returns v; otherwise it returns null. (There can be at most one such mapping.)
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public V put(K key,      V value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Associates the specified value with the specified key in this map. If the map previously contained a mapping for the key, the old value is replaced.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public V remove(Object key)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes the mapping for the specified key from this map if present.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean containsValue(Object value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this map maps one or more keys to the specified value. This operation requires time linear in the map size. Additionally, it is possible for the map to change during execution of this method, in which case the returned result may be inaccurate.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int size()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map. If this map contains more than Integer.MAX_VALUE elements, it returns Integer.MAX_VALUE. Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the asynchronous nature of these maps, determining the current number of elements requires traversing them all to count them. Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during execution of this method, in which case the returned result will be inaccurate. Thus, this method is typically not very useful in concurrent applications.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isEmpty()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this map contains no key-value mappings.
				</description>

				</name>
				<description>
					Removes all of the mappings from this map.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public NavigableSet<K> keySet()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a NavigableSet view of the keys contained in this map. The set's iterator returns the keys in ascending order. The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll, retainAll, and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations. The view's iterator is a "weakly consistent" iterator that will never throw ConcurrentModificationException, and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the iterator, and may (but is not guaranteed to) reflect any modifications subsequent to construction. This method is equivalent to method navigableKeySet.

The descending map is backed by this map, so changes to the map are reflected in the descending map, and vice-versa. The returned map has an ordering equivalent to Collections.reverseOrder(comparator()). The expression m.descendingMap().descendingMap() returns a view of m essentially equivalent to m.

				<name>
					public boolean equals(Object o)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares the specified object with this map for equality. Returns true if the given object is also a map and the two maps represent the same mappings. More formally, two maps m1 and m2 represent the same mappings if m1.entrySet().equals(m2.entrySet()). This operation may return misleading results if either map is concurrently modified during execution of this method.
