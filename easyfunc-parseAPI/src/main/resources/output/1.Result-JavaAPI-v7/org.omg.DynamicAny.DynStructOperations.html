		<description>
			DynStruct objects support the manipulation of IDL struct and exception values. Members of the exceptions are handled in the same way as members of a struct.

			<method>
				<name>
					String current_member_name()                             throws TypeMismatch,                                    InvalidValue
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the name of the member at the current position. This operation may return an empty string since the TypeCode of the value being manipulated may not contain the names of members.

					TCKind current_member_kind()                             throws TypeMismatch,                                    InvalidValue
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the TCKind associated with the member at the current position.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					NameValuePair[] get_members()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a sequence of NameValuePairs describing the name and the value of each member in the struct associated with a DynStruct object. The sequence contains members in the same order as the declaration order of members as indicated by the DynStruct's TypeCode. The current position is not affected. The member names in the returned sequence will be empty strings if the DynStruct's TypeCode does not contain member names.

					void set_members(NameValuePair[] value)                   throws TypeMismatch,                          InvalidValue
				</name>
				<description>
					Initializes the struct data value associated with a DynStruct object from a sequence of NameValuePairs. The operation sets the current position to zero if the passed sequences has non-zero length. Otherwise, if an empty sequence is passed, the current position is set to -1. Members must appear in the NameValuePairs in the order in which they appear in the IDL specification of the struct as indicated by the DynStruct's TypeCode or they must be empty strings. The operation makes no attempt to assign member values based on member names.

			<method>
				<name>
					NameDynAnyPair[] get_members_as_dyn_any()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a sequence of NameDynAnyPairs describing the name and the value of each member in the struct associated with a DynStruct object. The sequence contains members in the same order as the declaration order of members as indicated by the DynStruct's TypeCode. The current position is not affected. The member names in the returned sequence will be empty strings if the DynStruct's TypeCode does not contain member names.

Members must appear in the NameDynAnyPairs in the order in which they appear in the IDL specification of the struct as indicated by the DynStruct's TypeCode or they must be empty strings.
