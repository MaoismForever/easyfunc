			public class HandlerBase  extends Object  implements EntityResolver, DTDHandler, DocumentHandler, ErrorHandler
		</name>
		<description>
			Deprecated.  This class works with the deprecated DocumentHandler interface. It has been replaced by the SAX2 DefaultHandler class. Default base class for handlers. This module, both source code and documentation, is in the Public Domain, and comes with NO WARRANTY. See http://www.saxproject.org for further information. This class implements the default behaviour for four SAX1 interfaces: EntityResolver, DTDHandler, DocumentHandler, and ErrorHandler. It is now obsolete, but is included in SAX2 to support legacy SAX1 applications. SAX2 applications should use the DefaultHandler class instead. Application writers can extend this class when they need to implement only part of an interface; parser writers can instantiate this class to provide default handlers when the application has not supplied its own. Note that the use of this class is optional.

				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated.  Resolve an external entity. Always return null, so that the parser will use the system identifier provided in the XML document. This method implements the SAX default behaviour: application writers can override it in a subclass to do special translations such as catalog lookups or URI redirection.

					Deprecated.  Receive notification of a notation declaration. By default, do nothing. Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they wish to keep track of the notations declared in a document.

				<description>
					Deprecated.  Receive notification of character data inside an element. By default, do nothing. Application writers may override this method to take specific actions for each chunk of character data (such as adding the data to a node or buffer, or printing it to a file).

				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated.  Receive notification of a processing instruction. By default, do nothing. Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each processing instruction, such as setting status variables or invoking other methods.

					public void warning(SAXParseException e)               throws SAXException
				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated.  Receive notification of a parser warning. The default implementation does nothing. Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each warning, such as inserting the message in a log file or printing it to the console.

				<description>
					Deprecated.  Receive notification of a recoverable parser error. The default implementation does nothing. Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each error, such as inserting the message in a log file or printing it to the console.

					public void fatalError(SAXParseException e)                  throws SAXException
				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated.  Report a fatal XML parsing error. The default implementation throws a SAXParseException. Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they need to take specific actions for each fatal error (such as collecting all of the errors into a single report): in any case, the application must stop all regular processing when this method is invoked, since the document is no longer reliable, and the parser may no longer report parsing events.
