		<description>
			The PackedColorModel class is an abstract ColorModel class that works with pixel values which represent color and alpha information as separate samples and which pack all samples for a single pixel into a single int, short, or byte quantity. This class can be used with an arbitrary ColorSpace. The number of color samples in the pixel values must be the same as the number of color components in the ColorSpace. There can be a single alpha sample. The array length is always 1 for those methods that use a primitive array pixel representation of type transferType. The transfer types supported are DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, and DataBuffer.TYPE_INT. Color and alpha samples are stored in the single element of the array in bits indicated by bit masks. Each bit mask must be contiguous and masks must not overlap. The same masks apply to the single int pixel representation used by other methods. The correspondence of masks and color/alpha samples is as follows: Masks are identified by indices running from 0 through getNumComponents - 1. The first getNumColorComponents indices refer to color samples. If an alpha sample is present, it corresponds the last index. The order of the color indices is specified by the ColorSpace. Typically, this reflects the name of the color space type (for example, TYPE_RGB), index 0 corresponds to red, index 1 to green, and index 2 to blue. The translation from pixel values to color/alpha components for display or processing purposes is a one-to-one correspondence of samples to components. A PackedColorModel is typically used with image data that uses masks to define packed samples. For example, a PackedColorModel can be used in conjunction with a SinglePixelPackedSampleModel to construct a BufferedImage. Normally the masks used by the SampleModel and the ColorModel would be the same. However, if they are different, the color interpretation of pixel data is done according to the masks of the ColorModel. A single int pixel representation is valid for all objects of this class since it is always possible to represent pixel values used with this class in a single int. Therefore, methods that use this representation do not throw an IllegalArgumentException due to an invalid pixel value. A subclass of PackedColorModel is DirectColorModel, which is similar to an X11 TrueColor visual.

					public PackedColorModel(ColorSpace space,                  int bits,                  int[] colorMaskArray,                  int alphaMask,                  boolean isAlphaPremultiplied,                  int trans,                  int transferType)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a PackedColorModel from a color mask array, which specifies which bits in an int pixel representation contain each of the color samples, and an alpha mask. Color components are in the specified ColorSpace. The length of colorMaskArray should be the number of components in the ColorSpace. All of the bits in each mask must be contiguous and fit in the specified number of least significant bits of an int pixel representation. If the alphaMask is 0, there is no alpha. If there is alpha, the boolean isAlphaPremultiplied specifies how to interpret color and alpha samples in pixel values. If the boolean is true, color samples are assumed to have been multiplied by the alpha sample. The transparency, trans, specifies what alpha values can be represented by this color model. The transfer type is the type of primitive array used to represent pixel values.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a PackedColorModel from the specified masks which indicate which bits in an int pixel representation contain the alpha, red, green and blue color samples. Color components are in the specified ColorSpace, which must be of type ColorSpace.TYPE_RGB. All of the bits in each mask must be contiguous and fit in the specified number of least significant bits of an int pixel representation. If amask is 0, there is no alpha. If there is alpha, the boolean isAlphaPremultiplied specifies how to interpret color and alpha samples in pixel values. If the boolean is true, color samples are assumed to have been multiplied by the alpha sample. The transparency, trans, specifies what alpha values can be represented by this color model. The transfer type is the type of primitive array used to represent pixel values.

					public final int getMask(int index)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the mask indicating which bits in a pixel contain the specified color/alpha sample. For color samples, index corresponds to the placement of color sample names in the color space. Thus, an index equal to 0 for a CMYK ColorSpace would correspond to Cyan and an index equal to 1 would correspond to Magenta. If there is alpha, the alpha index would be:         alphaIndex = numComponents() - 1;

					public WritableRaster getAlphaRaster(WritableRaster raster)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a WritableRaster representing the alpha channel of an image, extracted from the input WritableRaster. This method assumes that WritableRaster objects associated with this ColorModel store the alpha band, if present, as the last band of image data. Returns null if there is no separate spatial alpha channel associated with this ColorModel. This method creates a new WritableRaster, but shares the data array.

					Tests if the specified Object is an instance of PackedColorModel and equals this PackedColorModel.
