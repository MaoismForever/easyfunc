		<description>
			A model for a potentially unbounded sequence of object values. This model is similar to ListModel however there are some important differences: The number of sequence elements isn't neccessarily bounded. The model doesn't support indexed random access to sequence elements. Only three sequence values are accessible at a time: current, next and previous. The current sequence element, can be set. A SpinnerModel has three properties, only the first is read/write. value The current element of the sequence. nextValue The following element or null if value is the last element of the sequence. previousValue The preceeding element or null if value is the first element of the sequence. When the the value property changes, ChangeListeners are notified. SpinnerModel may choose to notify the ChangeListeners under other circumstances.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					Object getValue()
				</name>
				<description>
					The current element of the sequence. This element is usually displayed by the editor part of a JSpinner.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void setValue(Object value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Changes current value of the model, typically this value is displayed by the editor part of a JSpinner. If the SpinnerModel implementation doesn't support the specified value then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. For example a SpinnerModel for numbers might only support values that are integer multiples of ten. In that case, model.setValue(new Number(11)) would throw an exception.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Object getNextValue()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the object in the sequence that comes after the object returned by getValue(). If the end of the sequence has been reached then return null. Calling this method does not effect value.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Object getPreviousValue()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return the object in the sequence that comes before the object returned by getValue(). If the end of the sequence has been reached then return null. Calling this method does not effect value.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void addChangeListener(ChangeListener l)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a ChangeListener to the model's listener list. The ChangeListeners must be notified when models value changes.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void removeChangeListener(ChangeListener l)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes a ChangeListener from the model's listener list.
