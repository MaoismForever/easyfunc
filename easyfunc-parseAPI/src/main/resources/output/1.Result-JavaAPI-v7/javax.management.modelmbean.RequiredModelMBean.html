		</name>
		<description>
			This class is the implementation of a ModelMBean. An appropriate implementation of a ModelMBean must be shipped with every JMX Agent and the class must be named RequiredModelMBean. Java resources wishing to be manageable instantiate the RequiredModelMBean using the MBeanServer's createMBean method. The resource then sets the MBeanInfo and Descriptors for the RequiredModelMBean instance. The attributes and operations exposed via the ModelMBeanInfo for the ModelMBean are accessible from MBeans, connectors/adaptors like other MBeans. Through the Descriptors, values and methods in the managed application can be defined and mapped to attributes and operations of the ModelMBean. This mapping can be defined in an XML formatted file or dynamically and programmatically at runtime. Every RequiredModelMBean which is instantiated in the MBeanServer becomes manageable: its attributes and operations become remotely accessible through the connectors/adaptors connected to that MBeanServer. A Java object cannot be registered in the MBeanServer unless it is a JMX compliant MBean. By instantiating a RequiredModelMBean, resources are guaranteed that the MBean is valid. MBeanException and RuntimeOperationsException must be thrown on every public method. This allows for wrapping exceptions from distributed communications (RMI, EJB, etc.)

					public RequiredModelMBean()                     throws MBeanException,                            RuntimeOperationsException
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an RequiredModelMBean with an empty ModelMBeanInfo. The RequiredModelMBean's MBeanInfo and Descriptors can be customized using the setModelMBeanInfo(javax.management.modelmbean.ModelMBeanInfo) method. After the RequiredModelMBean's MBeanInfo and Descriptors are customized, the RequiredModelMBean can be registered with the MBeanServer.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a RequiredModelMBean object using ModelMBeanInfo passed in. As long as the RequiredModelMBean is not registered with the MBeanServer yet, the RequiredModelMBean's MBeanInfo and Descriptors can be customized using the setModelMBeanInfo(javax.management.modelmbean.ModelMBeanInfo) method. After the RequiredModelMBean's MBeanInfo and Descriptors are customized, the RequiredModelMBean can be registered with the MBeanServer.

				</name>
				<description>
					Initializes a ModelMBean object using ModelMBeanInfo passed in. This method makes it possible to set a customized ModelMBeanInfo on the ModelMBean as long as it is not registered with the MBeanServer. Once the ModelMBean's ModelMBeanInfo (with Descriptors) are customized and set on the ModelMBean, the ModelMBean be registered with the MBeanServer. If the ModelMBean is currently registered, this method throws a RuntimeOperationsException wrapping an IllegalStateException If the given inModelMBeanInfo does not contain any ModelMBeanNotificationInfo for the GENERIC or ATTRIBUTE_CHANGE notifications, then the RequiredModelMBean will supply its own default ModelMBeanNotificationInfos for those missing notifications.

				</name>
				<description>
					Instantiates this MBean instance with the data found for the MBean in the persistent store. The data loaded could include attribute and operation values. This method should be called during construction or initialization of this instance, and before the MBean is registered with the MBeanServer. If the implementation of this class does not support persistence, an MBeanException wrapping a ServiceNotFoundException is thrown.

				</name>
				<description>
					Captures the current state of this MBean instance and writes it out to the persistent store. The state stored could include attribute and operation values. If the implementation of this class does not support persistence, an MBeanException wrapping a ServiceNotFoundException is thrown. Persistence policy from the MBean and attribute descriptor is used to guide execution of this method. The MBean should be stored if 'persistPolicy' field is:   != "never"     = "always"     = "onTimer" and now > 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod'     = "NoMoreOftenThan" and now > 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod'     = "onUnregister"   Do not store the MBean if 'persistPolicy' field is:       = "never"      = "onUpdate"      = "onTimer" && now < 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod'

					public Object invoke(String opName,              Object[] opArgs,              String[] sig)                throws MBeanException,                       ReflectionException
				</name>
				<description>
					Invokes a method on or through a RequiredModelMBean and returns the result of the method execution. If the given method to be invoked, together with the provided signature, matches one of RequiredModelMbean accessible methods, this one will be call. Otherwise the call to the given method will be tried on the managed resource. The last value returned by an operation may be cached in the operation's descriptor which is in the ModelMBeanOperationInfo's descriptor. The valid value will be in the 'value' field if there is one. If the 'currencyTimeLimit' field in the descriptor is: <0 Then the value is not cached and is never valid. The operation method is invoked. The 'value' and 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' fields are cleared. =0 Then the value is always cached and always valid. The 'value' field is returned. If there is no 'value' field then the operation method is invoked for the attribute. The 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' field and `value' fields are set to the operation's return value and the current time stamp. >0 Represents the number of seconds that the 'value' field is valid. The 'value' field is no longer valid when 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' + 'currencyTimeLimit' > Now. When 'value' is valid, 'value' is returned. When 'value' is no longer valid then the operation method is invoked. The 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' field and `value' fields are updated. Note: because of inconsistencies in previous versions of this specification, it is recommended not to use negative or zero values for currencyTimeLimit. To indicate that a cached value is never valid, omit the currencyTimeLimit field. To indicate that it is always valid, use a very large number for this field.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value of a specific attribute defined for this ModelMBean. The last value returned by an attribute may be cached in the attribute's descriptor. The valid value will be in the 'value' field if there is one. If the 'currencyTimeLimit' field in the descriptor is: <0 Then the value is not cached and is never valid. The getter method is invoked for the attribute. The 'value' and 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' fields are cleared. =0 Then the value is always cached and always valid. The 'value' field is returned. If there is no'value' field then the getter method is invoked for the attribute. The 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' field and `value' fields are set to the attribute's value and the current time stamp. >0 Represents the number of seconds that the 'value' field is valid. The 'value' field is no longer valid when 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' + 'currencyTimeLimit' > Now. When 'value' is valid, 'value' is returned. When 'value' is no longer valid then the getter method is invoked for the attribute. The 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' field and `value' fields are updated. Note: because of inconsistencies in previous versions of this specification, it is recommended not to use negative or zero values for currencyTimeLimit. To indicate that a cached value is never valid, omit the currencyTimeLimit field. To indicate that it is always valid, use a very large number for this field. If the 'getMethod' field contains the name of a valid operation descriptor, then the method described by the operation descriptor is executed. The response from the method is returned as the value of the attribute. If the operation fails or the returned value is not compatible with the declared type of the attribute, an exception will be thrown. If no 'getMethod' field is defined then the default value of the attribute is returned. If the returned value is not compatible with the declared type of the attribute, an exception will be thrown. The declared type of the attribute is the String returned by MBeanAttributeInfo.getType(). A value is compatible with this type if one of the following is true: the value is null; the declared name is a primitive type name (such as "int") and the value is an instance of the corresponding wrapper type (such as java.lang.Integer); the name of the value's class is identical to the declared name; the declared name can be loaded by the value's class loader and produces a class to which the value can be assigned. In this implementation, in every case where the getMethod needs to be called, because the method is invoked through the standard "invoke" method and thus needs operationInfo, an operation must be specified for that getMethod so that the invocation works correctly.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the value of a specific attribute of a named ModelMBean. If the 'setMethod' field of the attribute's descriptor contains the name of a valid operation descriptor, then the method described by the operation descriptor is executed. In this implementation, the operation descriptor must be specified correctly and assigned to the modelMBeanInfo so that the 'setMethod' works correctly. The response from the method is set as the value of the attribute in the descriptor. If currencyTimeLimit is > 0, then the new value for the attribute is cached in the attribute descriptor's 'value' field and the 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' field is set to the current time stamp. If the persist field of the attribute's descriptor is not null then Persistence policy from the attribute descriptor is used to guide storing the attribute in a persistent store. Store the MBean if 'persistPolicy' field is: != "never" = "always" = "onUpdate" = "onTimer" and now > 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod' = "NoMoreOftenThan" and now > 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod' Do not store the MBean if 'persistPolicy' field is: = "never" = "onTimer" && now < 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod' = "onUnregister" = "NoMoreOftenThan" and now < 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod' The ModelMBeanInfo of the Model MBean is stored in a file.
