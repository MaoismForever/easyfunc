			public interface InitialContextFactory
		</name>
		<description>
			This interface represents a factory that creates an initial context. The JNDI framework allows for different initial context implementations to be specified at runtime. The initial context is created using an initial context factory. An initial context factory must implement the InitialContextFactory interface, which provides a method for creating instances of initial context that implement the Context interface. In addition, the factory class must be public and must have a public constructor that accepts no arguments.

				<description>
					Creates an Initial Context for beginning name resolution. Special requirements of this context are supplied using environment. The environment parameter is owned by the caller. The implementation will not modify the object or keep a reference to it, although it may keep a reference to a clone or copy.
