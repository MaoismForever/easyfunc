		<description>
			Service delegates are used internally by Service objects to allow pluggability of JAX-WS implementations. Every Service object has its own delegate, created using the Provider.createServiceDelegate(java.net.URL, javax.xml.namespace.QName, java.lang.Class<? extends javax.xml.ws.Service>) method. A Service object delegates all of its instance methods to its delegate.

				<description>
					The getPort method returns a proxy. The parameter endpointReference specifies the endpoint that will be invoked by the returned proxy. If there are any reference parameters in the endpointReference, then those reference parameters MUST appear as SOAP headers, indicating them to be reference parameters, on all messages sent to the endpoint. The endpointReference's address MUST be used for invocations on the endpoint. The parameter serviceEndpointInterface specifies the service endpoint interface that is supported by the returned proxy. In the implementation of this method, the JAX-WS runtime system takes the responsibility of selecting a protocol binding (and a port) and configuring the proxy accordingly from the WSDL associated with this Service instance or from the metadata from the endpointReference. If this Service instance has a WSDL and the endpointReference metadata also has a WSDL, then the WSDL from this instance MUST be used. If this Service instance does not have a WSDL and the endpointReference does have a WSDL, then the WSDL from the endpointReference MAY be used. The returned proxy should not be reconfigured by the client. If this Service instance has a known proxy port that matches the information contained in the WSDL, then that proxy is returned, otherwise a WebServiceException is thrown. Calling this method has the same behavior as the following    port = service.getPort(portName, serviceEndpointInterface);   where the portName is retrieved from the metadata of the endpointReference or from the serviceEndpointInterface and the WSDL associated with this Service instance.
