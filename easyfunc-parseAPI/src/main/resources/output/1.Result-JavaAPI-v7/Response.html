		<description>
			The Response interface provides methods used to obtain the payload and context of a message sent in response to an operation invocation. For asynchronous operation invocations it provides additional methods to check the status of the request. The get(...) methods may throw the standard set of exceptions and their cause may be a RemoteException or a WebServiceException that represents the error that occured during the asynchronous method invocation.
