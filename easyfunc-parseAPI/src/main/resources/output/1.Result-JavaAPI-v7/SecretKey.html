		<description>
			A secret (symmetric) key. This interface contains no methods or constants. Its only purpose is to group (and provide type safety for) secret keys. Provider implementations of this interface must overwrite the equals and hashCode methods inherited from java.lang.Object, so that secret keys are compared based on their underlying key material and not based on reference. Keys that implement this interface return the string RAW as their encoding format (see getFormat), and return the raw key bytes as the result of a getEncoded method call. (The getFormat and getEncoded methods are inherited from the java.security.Key parent interface.)
