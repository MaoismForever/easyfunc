		<description>
			This is the superclass of security-related exceptions thrown by operations in the Context and DirContext interfaces. The nature of the failure is described by the name of the subclass. If the program wants to handle this exception in particular, it should catch NamingSecurityException explicitly before attempting to catch NamingException. A program might want to do this, for example, if it wants to treat security-related exceptions specially from other sorts of naming exception. Synchronization and serialization issues that apply to NamingException apply directly here.
