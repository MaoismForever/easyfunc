		<description>
			To provide customized error handling, implement this interface and use the setErrorListener method to register an instance of the implmentation with the Transformer. The Transformer then reports all errors and warnings through this interface. If an application does not register its own custom ErrorListener, the default ErrorListener is used which reports all warnings and errors to System.err and does not throw any Exceptions. Applications are strongly encouraged to register and use ErrorListeners that insure proper behavior for warnings and errors. For transformation errors, a Transformer must use this interface instead of throwing an Exception: it is up to the application to decide whether to throw an Exception for different types of errors and warnings. Note however that the Transformer is not required to continue with the transformation after a call to fatalError(TransformerException exception). Transformers may use this mechanism to report XML parsing errors as well as transformation errors.

			<method>
				<name>
					void warning(TransformerException exception)               throws TransformerException
				</name>
				<description>
					Receive notification of a warning. Transformer can use this method to report conditions that are not errors or fatal errors. The default behaviour is to take no action. After invoking this method, the Transformer must continue with the transformation. It should still be possible for the application to process the document through to the end.

					void error(TransformerException exception)             throws TransformerException
				</name>
				<description>
					Receive notification of a recoverable error. The transformer must continue to try and provide normal transformation after invoking this method. It should still be possible for the application to process the document through to the end if no other errors are encountered.

			<method>
				<name>
					void fatalError(TransformerException exception)                  throws TransformerException
				</name>
				<description>
					Receive notification of a non-recoverable error. The processor may choose to continue, but will not normally proceed to a successful completion. The method should throw an exception if it is unable to process the error, or if it wishes execution to terminate immediately. The processor will not necessarily honor this request.
