		</name>
		<description>
			The abstract class URLConnection is the superclass of all classes that represent a communications link between the application and a URL. Instances of this class can be used both to read from and to write to the resource referenced by the URL. In general, creating a connection to a URL is a multistep process: openConnection() connect() Manipulate parameters that affect the connection to the remote resource. Interact with the resource; query header fields and contents. ----------------------------> time The connection object is created by invoking the openConnection method on a URL. The setup parameters and general request properties are manipulated. The actual connection to the remote object is made, using the connect method. The remote object becomes available. The header fields and the contents of the remote object can be accessed. The setup parameters are modified using the following methods: setAllowUserInteraction setDoInput setDoOutput setIfModifiedSince setUseCaches and the general request properties are modified using the method: setRequestProperty Default values for the AllowUserInteraction and UseCaches parameters can be set using the methods setDefaultAllowUserInteraction and setDefaultUseCaches. Each of the above set methods has a corresponding get method to retrieve the value of the parameter or general request property. The specific parameters and general request properties that are applicable are protocol specific. The following methods are used to access the header fields and the contents after the connection is made to the remote object: getContent getHeaderField getInputStream getOutputStream Certain header fields are accessed frequently. The methods: getContentEncoding getContentLength getContentType getDate getExpiration getLastModifed provide convenient access to these fields. The getContentType method is used by the getContent method to determine the type of the remote object; subclasses may find it convenient to override the getContentType method. In the common case, all of the pre-connection parameters and general request properties can be ignored: the pre-connection parameters and request properties default to sensible values. For most clients of this interface, there are only two interesting methods: getInputStream and getContent, which are mirrored in the URL class by convenience methods. More information on the request properties and header fields of an http connection can be found at:    http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt   Note about fileNameMap: In versions prior to JDK 1.1.6, field fileNameMap of URLConnection was public. In JDK 1.1.6 and later, fileNameMap is private; accessor and mutator methods getFileNameMap and setFileNameMap are added to access it. This change is also described on the Compatibility page. Invoking the close() methods on the InputStream or OutputStream of an URLConnection after a request may free network resources associated with this instance, unless particular protocol specifications specify different behaviours for it.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected URL url
				</name>
				<description>
					The URL represents the remote object on the World Wide Web to which this connection is opened. The value of this field can be accessed by the getURL method. The default value of this variable is the value of the URL argument in the URLConnection constructor.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected boolean doInput
				</name>
				<description>
					This variable is set by the setDoInput method. Its value is returned by the getDoInput method. A URL connection can be used for input and/or output. Setting the doInput flag to true indicates that the application intends to read data from the URL connection. The default value of this field is true.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected boolean doOutput
				</name>
				<description>
					This variable is set by the setDoOutput method. Its value is returned by the getDoOutput method. A URL connection can be used for input and/or output. Setting the doOutput flag to true indicates that the application intends to write data to the URL connection. The default value of this field is false.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected boolean allowUserInteraction
				</name>
				<description>
					If true, this URL is being examined in a context in which it makes sense to allow user interactions such as popping up an authentication dialog. If false, then no user interaction is allowed. The value of this field can be set by the setAllowUserInteraction method. Its value is returned by the getAllowUserInteraction method. Its default value is the value of the argument in the last invocation of the setDefaultAllowUserInteraction method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected boolean useCaches
				</name>
				<description>
					If true, the protocol is allowed to use caching whenever it can. If false, the protocol must always try to get a fresh copy of the object. This field is set by the setUseCaches method. Its value is returned by the getUseCaches method. Its default value is the value given in the last invocation of the setDefaultUseCaches method.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected long ifModifiedSince
				</name>
				<description>
					Some protocols support skipping the fetching of the object unless the object has been modified more recently than a certain time. A nonzero value gives a time as the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, GMT. The object is fetched only if it has been modified more recently than that time. This variable is set by the setIfModifiedSince method. Its value is returned by the getIfModifiedSince method. The default value of this field is 0, indicating that the fetching must always occur.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected boolean connected
				</name>
				<description>
					If false, this connection object has not created a communications link to the specified URL. If true, the communications link has been established.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected URLConnection(URL url)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a URL connection to the specified URL. A connection to the object referenced by the URL is not created.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static FileNameMap getFileNameMap()
				</name>
				<description>
					Loads filename map (a mimetable) from a data file. It will first try to load the user-specific table, defined by "content.types.user.table" property. If that fails, it tries to load the default built-in table at lib/content-types.properties under java home.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static void setFileNameMap(FileNameMap map)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the FileNameMap. If there is a security manager, this method first calls the security manager's checkSetFactory method to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result in a SecurityException.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void connect()                        throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Opens a communications link to the resource referenced by this URL, if such a connection has not already been established. If the connect method is called when the connection has already been opened (indicated by the connected field having the value true), the call is ignored. URLConnection objects go through two phases: first they are created, then they are connected. After being created, and before being connected, various options can be specified (e.g., doInput and UseCaches). After connecting, it is an error to try to set them. Operations that depend on being connected, like getContentLength, will implicitly perform the connection, if necessary.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setConnectTimeout(int timeout)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets a specified timeout value, in milliseconds, to be used when opening a communications link to the resource referenced by this URLConnection. If the timeout expires before the connection can be established, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. Some non-standard implmentation of this method may ignore the specified timeout. To see the connect timeout set, please call getConnectTimeout().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getConnectTimeout()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns setting for connect timeout. 0 return implies that the option is disabled (i.e., timeout of infinity).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setReadTimeout(int timeout)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the read timeout to a specified timeout, in milliseconds. A non-zero value specifies the timeout when reading from Input stream when a connection is established to a resource. If the timeout expires before there is data available for read, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. Some non-standard implementation of this method ignores the specified timeout. To see the read timeout set, please call getReadTimeout().
				</description>
				
			</method>

					public long getHeaderFieldDate(String name,                        long Default)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value of the named field parsed as date. The result is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 GMT represented by the named field. This form of getHeaderField exists because some connection types (e.g., http-ng) have pre-parsed headers. Classes for that connection type can override this method and short-circuit the parsing.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getHeaderFieldKey(int n)

			<method>
				<name>
					public String getHeaderField(int n)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value for the nth header field. It returns null if there are fewer than n+1fields. This method can be used in conjunction with the getHeaderFieldKey method to iterate through all the headers in the message.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object getContent()                    throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the contents of this URL connection. This method first determines the content type of the object by calling the getContentType method. If this is the first time that the application has seen that specific content type, a content handler for that content type is created: If the application has set up a content handler factory instance using the setContentHandlerFactory method, the createContentHandler method of that instance is called with the content type as an argument; the result is a content handler for that content type. If no content handler factory has yet been set up, or if the factory's createContentHandler method returns null, then the application loads the class named:            sun.net.www.content.<contentType>       where <contentType> is formed by taking the content-type string, replacing all slash characters with a period ('.'), and all other non-alphanumeric characters with the underscore character '_'. The alphanumeric characters are specifically the 26 uppercase ASCII letters 'A' through 'Z', the 26 lowercase ASCII letters 'a' through 'z', and the 10 ASCII digits '0' through '9'. If the specified class does not exist, or is not a subclass of ContentHandler, then an UnknownServiceException is thrown.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object getContent(Class[] classes)                    throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the contents of this URL connection.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Permission getPermission()                           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a permission object representing the permission necessary to make the connection represented by this object. This method returns null if no permission is required to make the connection. By default, this method returns java.security.AllPermission. Subclasses should override this method and return the permission that best represents the permission required to make a a connection to the URL. For example, a URLConnection representing a file: URL would return a java.io.FilePermission object. The permission returned may dependent upon the state of the connection. For example, the permission before connecting may be different from that after connecting. For example, an HTTP sever, say foo.com, may redirect the connection to a different host, say bar.com. Before connecting the permission returned by the connection will represent the permission needed to connect to foo.com, while the permission returned after connecting will be to bar.com. Permissions are generally used for two purposes: to protect caches of objects obtained through URLConnections, and to check the right of a recipient to learn about a particular URL. In the first case, the permission should be obtained after the object has been obtained. For example, in an HTTP connection, this will represent the permission to connect to the host from which the data was ultimately fetched. In the second case, the permission should be obtained and tested before connecting.

				<name>
					public void setUseCaches(boolean usecaches)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the value of the useCaches field of this URLConnection to the specified value. Some protocols do caching of documents. Occasionally, it is important to be able to "tunnel through" and ignore the caches (e.g., the "reload" button in a browser).

				<name>
					public static void setContentHandlerFactory(ContentHandlerFactory fac)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the ContentHandlerFactory of an application. It can be called at most once by an application.

				<name>
					public static String guessContentTypeFromStream(InputStream is)                                           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Tries to determine the type of an input stream based on the characters at the beginning of the input stream. This method can be used by subclasses that override the getContentType method. Ideally, this routine would not be needed. But many http servers return the incorrect content type; in addition, there are many nonstandard extensions. Direct inspection of the bytes to determine the content type is often more accurate than believing the content type claimed by the http server.
