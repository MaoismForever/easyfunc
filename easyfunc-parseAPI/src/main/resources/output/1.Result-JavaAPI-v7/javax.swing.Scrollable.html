			public interface Scrollable
		</name>
		<description>
			An interface that provides information to a scrolling container like JScrollPane. A complex component that's likely to be used as a viewing a JScrollPane viewport (or other scrolling container) should implement this interface.

			<method>
				<name>
					Dimension많etPreferredScrollableViewportSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the preferred size of the viewport for a view component. For example, the preferred size of a JList component is the size required to accommodate all of the cells in its list. However, the value of preferredScrollableViewportSize is the size required for JList.getVisibleRowCount rows. A component without any properties that would affect the viewport size should just return getPreferredSize here.

				</name>
				<description>
					Components that display logical rows or columns should compute the scroll increment that will completely expose one new row or column, depending on the value of orientation. Ideally, components should handle a partially exposed row or column by returning the distance required to completely expose the item. Scrolling containers, like JScrollPane, will use this method each time the user requests a unit scroll.

				<description>
					Components that display logical rows or columns should compute the scroll increment that will completely expose one block of rows or columns, depending on the value of orientation. Scrolling containers, like JScrollPane, will use this method each time the user requests a block scroll.

			<method>
				<name>
					boolean많etScrollableTracksViewportWidth()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return true if a viewport should always force the width of this Scrollable to match the width of the viewport. For example a normal text view that supported line wrapping would return true here, since it would be undesirable for wrapped lines to disappear beyond the right edge of the viewport. Note that returning true for a Scrollable whose ancestor is a JScrollPane effectively disables horizontal scrolling. Scrolling containers, like JViewport, will use this method each time they are validated.

			<method>
				<name>
					boolean많etScrollableTracksViewportHeight()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return true if a viewport should always force the height of this Scrollable to match the height of the viewport. For example a columnar text view that flowed text in left to right columns could effectively disable vertical scrolling by returning true here. Scrolling containers, like JViewport, will use this method each time they are validated.
