			public abstract class Certificate  extends Object  implements Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			Abstract class for managing a variety of identity certificates. An identity certificate is a binding of a principal to a public key which is vouched for by another principal. (A principal represents an entity such as an individual user, a group, or a corporation.) This class is an abstraction for certificates that have different formats but important common uses. For example, different types of certificates, such as X.509 and PGP, share general certificate functionality (like encoding and verifying) and some types of information (like a public key). X.509, PGP, and SDSI certificates can all be implemented by subclassing the Certificate class, even though they contain different sets of information, and they store and retrieve the information in different ways.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected Certificate(String type)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a certificate of the specified type.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final String getType()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the type of this certificate.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean equals(Object other)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares this certificate for equality with the specified object. If the other object is an instanceof Certificate, then its encoded form is retrieved and compared with the encoded form of this certificate.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int hashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a hashcode value for this certificate from its encoded form.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract byte[] getEncoded()                             throws CertificateEncodingException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the encoded form of this certificate. It is assumed that each certificate type would have only a single form of encoding; for example, X.509 certificates would be encoded as ASN.1 DER.

				</name>
				<description>
					Verifies that this certificate was signed using the private key that corresponds to the specified public key.
				</description>

					public abstract void verify(PublicKey key,            String sigProvider)                       throws CertificateException,                              NoSuchAlgorithmException,                              InvalidKeyException,                              NoSuchProviderException,                              SignatureException
				</name>
				<description>
					Verifies that this certificate was signed using the private key that corresponds to the specified public key. This method uses the signature verification engine supplied by the specified provider.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this certificate.
				</description>

					public abstract PublicKey getPublicKey()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the public key from this certificate.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					protected Object writeReplace()                         throws ObjectStreamException
				</name>
				<description>
					Replace the Certificate to be serialized.
