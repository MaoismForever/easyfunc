			public abstract class Activatable  extends RemoteServer
		</name>
		<description>
			The Activatable class provides support for remote objects that require persistent access over time and that can be activated by the system. For the constructors and static exportObject methods, the stub for a remote object being exported is obtained as described in UnicastRemoteObject. An attempt to serialize explicitly an instance of this class will fail.

				<description>
					Constructs an activatable remote object by registering an activation descriptor (with the specified location, data, and restart mode) for this object, and exporting the object with the specified port. Note: Using the Activatable constructors that both register and export an activatable remote object is strongly discouraged because the actions of registering and exporting the remote object are not guaranteed to be atomic. Instead, an application should register an activation descriptor and export a remote object separately, so that exceptions can be handled properly. This method invokes the exportObject method with this object, and the specified location, data, restart mode, and port. Subsequent calls to getID() will return the activation identifier returned from the call to exportObject.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructor used to activate/export the object on a specified port. An "activatable" remote object must have a constructor that takes two arguments: the object's activation identifier (ActivationID), and the object's initialization data (a MarshalledObject). A concrete subclass of this class must call this constructor when it is activated via the two parameter constructor described above. As a side-effect of construction, the remote object is "exported" to the RMI runtime (on the specified port) and is available to accept incoming calls from clients.

				</name>
				<description>
					Informs the system that the object with the corresponding activation id is currently inactive. If the object is currently active, the object is "unexported" from the RMI runtime (only if there are no pending or in-progress calls) so the that it can no longer receive incoming calls. This call informs this VM's ActivationGroup that the object is inactive, that, in turn, informs its ActivationMonitor. If this call completes successfully, a subsequent activate request to the activator will cause the object to reactivate. The operation may still succeed if the object is considered active but has already unexported itself.

				<description>
					Registers an activation descriptor (with the specified location, data, and restart mode) for the specified object, and exports that object with the specified port, and the specified client and server socket factories. Note: Using this method (as well as the Activatable constructors that both register and export an activatable remote object) is strongly discouraged because the actions of registering and exporting the remote object are not guaranteed to be atomic. Instead, an application should register an activation descriptor and export a remote object separately, so that exceptions can be handled properly. This method first registers an activation descriptor for the specified object as follows. It obtains the activation system by invoking the method ActivationGroup.getSystem. This method then obtains an ActivationID for the object by invoking the activation system's registerObject method with an ActivationDesc constructed with the specified object's class name, and the specified location, data, and restart mode. If an exception occurs obtaining the activation system or registering the activation descriptor, that exception is thrown to the caller. Next, this method exports the object by invoking the exportObject method with the specified remote object, the activation identifier obtained from registration, the specified port, and the specified client and server socket factories. If an exception occurs exporting the object, this method attempts to unregister the activation identifier (obtained from registration) by invoking the activation system's unregisterObject method with the activation identifier. If an exception occurs unregistering the identifier, that exception is ignored, and the original exception that occurred exporting the object is thrown to the caller. Finally, this method invokes the activeObject method on the activation group in this VM with the activation identifier and the specified remote object, and returns the activation identifier to the caller.

				</name>
				<description>
					Export the activatable remote object to the RMI runtime to make the object available to receive incoming calls. The object is exported on an anonymous port, if port is zero. During activation, this exportObject method should be invoked explicitly by an "activatable" object, that does not extend the Activatable class. There is no need for objects that do extend the Activatable class to invoke this method directly because the object is exported during construction.

				</name>
				<description>
					Remove the remote object, obj, from the RMI runtime. If successful, the object can no longer accept incoming RMI calls. If the force parameter is true, the object is forcibly unexported even if there are pending calls to the remote object or the remote object still has calls in progress. If the force parameter is false, the object is only unexported if there are no pending or in progress calls to the object.
