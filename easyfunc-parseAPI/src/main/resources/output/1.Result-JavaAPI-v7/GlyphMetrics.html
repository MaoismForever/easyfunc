		<description>
			The GlyphMetrics class represents infomation for a single glyph. A glyph is the visual representation of one or more characters. Many different glyphs can be used to represent a single character or combination of characters. GlyphMetrics instances are produced by Font and are applicable to a specific glyph in a particular Font. Glyphs are either STANDARD, LIGATURE, COMBINING, or COMPONENT. STANDARD glyphs are commonly used to represent single characters. LIGATURE glyphs are used to represent sequences of characters. COMPONENT glyphs in a GlyphVector do not correspond to a particular character in a text model. Instead, COMPONENT glyphs are added for typographical reasons, such as Arabic justification. COMBINING glyphs embellish STANDARD or LIGATURE glyphs, such as accent marks. Carets do not appear before COMBINING glyphs. Other metrics available through GlyphMetrics are the components of the advance, the visual bounds, and the left and right side bearings. Glyphs for a rotated font, or obtained from a GlyphVector which has applied a rotation to the glyph, can have advances that contain both X and Y components. Usually the advance only has one component. The advance of a glyph is the distance from the glyph's origin to the origin of the next glyph along the baseline, which is either vertical or horizontal. Note that, in a GlyphVector, the distance from a glyph to its following glyph might not be the glyph's advance, because of kerning or other positioning adjustments. The bounds is the smallest rectangle that completely contains the outline of the glyph. The bounds rectangle is relative to the glyph's origin. The left-side bearing is the distance from the glyph origin to the left of its bounds rectangle. If the left-side bearing is negative, part of the glyph is drawn to the left of its origin. The right-side bearing is the distance from the right side of the bounds rectangle to the next glyph origin (the origin plus the advance). If negative, part of the glyph is drawn to the right of the next glyph's origin. Note that the bounds does not necessarily enclose all the pixels affected when rendering the glyph, because of rasterization and pixel adjustment effects. Although instances of GlyphMetrics can be directly constructed, they are almost always obtained from a GlyphVector. Once constructed, GlyphMetrics objects are immutable. Example: Querying a Font for glyph information    Font font = ...;   int glyphIndex = ...;   GlyphMetrics metrics = GlyphVector.getGlyphMetrics(glyphIndex);   int isStandard = metrics.isStandard();   float glyphAdvance = metrics.getAdvance();

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final byte STANDARD
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates a glyph that represents a single standard character.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final byte LIGATURE
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates a glyph that represents multiple characters as a ligature, for example 'fi' or 'ffi'. It is followed by filler glyphs for the remaining characters. Filler and combining glyphs can be intermixed to control positioning of accent marks on the logically preceeding ligature.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final byte COMBINING
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates a glyph that represents a combining character, such as an umlaut. There is no caret position between this glyph and the preceeding glyph.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final byte COMPONENT
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates a glyph with no corresponding character in the backing store. The glyph is associated with the character represented by the logicaly preceeding non-component glyph. This is used for kashida justification or other visual modifications to existing glyphs. There is no caret position between this glyph and the preceeding glyph.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final byte WHITESPACE
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates a glyph with no visual representation. It can be added to the other code values to indicate an invisible glyph.

			<method>
				<name>
					public float getAdvance()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the advance of the glyph along the baseline (either horizontal or vertical).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public float getAdvanceX()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the x-component of the advance of the glyph.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Rectangle2D getBounds2D()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the bounds of the glyph. This is the bounding box of the glyph outline. Because of rasterization and pixel alignment effects, it does not necessarily enclose the pixels that are affected when rendering the glyph.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public float getLSB()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the left (top) side bearing of the glyph. This is the distance from 0, 0 to the left (top) of the glyph bounds. If the bounds of the glyph is to the left of (above) the origin, the LSB is negative.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public float getRSB()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the right (bottom) side bearing of the glyph. This is the distance from the right (bottom) of the glyph bounds to the advance. If the bounds of the glyph is to the right of (below) the advance, the RSB is negative.
