		<description>
			A Red-Black tree based NavigableMap implementation. The map is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time, depending on which constructor is used. This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the containsKey, get, put and remove operations. Algorithms are adaptations of those in Cormen, Leiserson, and Rivest's Introduction to Algorithms. Note that the ordering maintained by a tree map, like any sorted map, and whether or not an explicit comparator is provided, must be consistent with equals if this sorted map is to correctly implement the Map interface. (See Comparable or Comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals.) This is so because the Map interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but a sorted map performs all key comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted map, equal. The behavior of a sorted map is well-defined even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the Map interface. Note that this implementation is not synchronized. If multiple threads access a map concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the map structurally, it must be synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more mappings; merely changing the value associated with an existing key is not a structural modification.) This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the map. If no such object exists, the map should be "wrapped" using the Collections.synchronizedSortedMap method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the map:      SortedMap m = Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new TreeMap(...)); The iterators returned by the iterator method of the collections returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are fail-fast: if the map is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own remove method, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future. Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs. All Map.Entry pairs returned by methods in this class and its views represent snapshots of mappings at the time they were produced. They do not support the Entry.setValue method. (Note however that it is possible to change mappings in the associated map using put.) This class is a member of the Java Collections Framework.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public TreeMap()
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new, empty tree map, using the natural ordering of its keys. All keys inserted into the map must implement the Comparable interface. Furthermore, all such keys must be mutually comparable: k1.compareTo(k2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any keys k1 and k2 in the map. If the user attempts to put a key into the map that violates this constraint (for example, the user attempts to put a string key into a map whose keys are integers), the put(Object key, Object value) call will throw a ClassCastException.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public TreeMap(Comparator<? super K> comparator)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new, empty tree map, ordered according to the given comparator. All keys inserted into the map must be mutually comparable by the given comparator: comparator.compare(k1, k2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any keys k1 and k2 in the map. If the user attempts to put a key into the map that violates this constraint, the put(Object key, Object value) call will throw a ClassCastException.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public TreeMap(Map<? extends K,? extends V> m)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new tree map containing the same mappings as the given map, ordered according to the natural ordering of its keys. All keys inserted into the new map must implement the Comparable interface. Furthermore, all such keys must be mutually comparable: k1.compareTo(k2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any keys k1 and k2 in the map. This method runs in n*log(n) time.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public TreeMap(SortedMap<K,? extends V> m)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a new tree map containing the same mappings and using the same ordering as the specified sorted map. This method runs in linear time.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int size()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the number of key-value mappings in this map.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean containsKey(Object key)
				</name>
				<description>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean containsValue(Object value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if this map maps one or more keys to the specified value. More formally, returns true if and only if this map contains at least one mapping to a value v such that (value==null ? v==null : value.equals(v)). This operation will probably require time linear in the map size for most implementations.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public V get(Object key)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, or null if this map contains no mapping for the key. More formally, if this map contains a mapping from a key k to a value v such that key compares equal to k according to the map's ordering, then this method returns v; otherwise it returns null. (There can be at most one such mapping.) A return value of null does not necessarily indicate that the map contains no mapping for the key; it's also possible that the map explicitly maps the key to null. The containsKey operation may be used to distinguish these two cases.

					Returns a Set view of the keys contained in this map. The set's iterator returns the keys in ascending order.

				<description>
					Returns a Collection view of the values contained in this map. The collection's iterator returns the values in ascending order of the corresponding keys. The collection is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the collection, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration over the collection is in progress (except through the iterator's own remove operation), the results of the iteration are undefined.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Set view of the mappings contained in this map. The set's iterator returns the entries in ascending key order. The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa. If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through the iterator's own remove operation, or through the setValue operation on a map entry returned by the iterator) the results of the iteration are undefined. The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll, retainAll and clear operations. It does not support the add or addAll operations.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public NavigableMap<K,V> descendingMap()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: NavigableMap Returns a reverse order view of the mappings contained in this map. The descending map is backed by this map, so changes to the map are reflected in the descending map, and vice-versa. If either map is modified while an iteration over a collection view of either map is in progress (except through the iterator's own remove operation), the results of the iteration are undefined. The returned map has an ordering equivalent to Collections.reverseOrder(comparator()). The expression m.descendingMap().descendingMap() returns a view of m essentially equivalent to m.
