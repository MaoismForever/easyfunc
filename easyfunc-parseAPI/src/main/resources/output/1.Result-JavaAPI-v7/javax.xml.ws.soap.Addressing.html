		<description>
			This annotation represents the use of WS-Addressing with either the SOAP 1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP binding. Using this annotation with any other binding is undefined. This annotation MUST only be used in conjunction with the WebService, WebServiceProvider, and WebServiceRef annotations. When used with a javax.jws.WebService annotation, this annotation MUST only be used on the service endpoint implementation class. When used with a WebServiceRef annotation, this annotation MUST only be used when a proxy instance is created. The injected SEI proxy, and endpoint MUST honor the values of the Addressing annotation. This annotation's behaviour is defined by the corresponding feature AddressingFeature.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract boolean enabled
				</name>
				<description>
					Specifies if this feature is enabled or disabled. If enabled, it means the endpoint supports WS-Addressing but does not require its use. Corresponding 3.1.1 Addressing Assertion must be generated in the generated WSDL.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract boolean required
				</name>
				<description>
					If addressing is enabled, this property determines whether the endpoint requires WS-Addressing. If required is true, the endpoint requires WS-Addressing and WS-Addressing headers MUST be present on incoming messages. A corresponding 3.1.1 Addressing Assertion must be generated in the WSDL.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract AddressingFeature.Responses responses
				</name>
				<description>
					If addressing is enabled, this property determines whether endpoint requires the use of anonymous responses, or non-anonymous responses, or all. AddressingFeature.Responses.ALL supports all response types and this is the default value. AddressingFeature.Responses.ANONYMOUS requires the use of only anonymous responses. It will result into wsam:AnonymousResponses nested assertion as specified in 3.1.2 AnonymousResponses Assertion in the generated WSDL. AddressingFeature.Responses.NON_ANONYMOUS requires the use of only non-anonymous responses. It will result into wsam:NonAnonymousResponses nested assertion as specified in 3.1.3 NonAnonymousResponses Assertion in the generated WSDL.
