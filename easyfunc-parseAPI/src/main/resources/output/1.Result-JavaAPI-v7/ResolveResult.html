			public class ResolveResult  extends Object  implements Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			This class represents the result of resolution of a name. It contains the object to which name was resolved, and the portion of the name that has not been resolved. A ResolveResult instance is not synchronized against concurrent multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a single ResolveResult instance should lock the object.
