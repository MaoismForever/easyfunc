		<description>
			The listener interface for receiving drag gesture events. This interface is intended for a drag gesture recognition implementation. See a specification for DragGestureRecognizer for details on how to register the listener interface. Upon recognition of a drag gesture the DragGestureRecognizer calls this interface's dragGestureRecognized() method and passes a DragGestureEvent.
