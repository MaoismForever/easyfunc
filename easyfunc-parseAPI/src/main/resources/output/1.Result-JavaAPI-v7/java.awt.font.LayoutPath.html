		<description>
			LayoutPath provides a mapping between locations relative to the baseline and points in user space. Locations consist of an advance along the baseline, and an offset perpendicular to the baseline at the advance. Positive values along the perpendicular are in the direction that is 90 degrees clockwise from the baseline vector. Locations are represented as a Point2D, where x is the advance and y is the offset.

				</name>
				<description>
					Convert a point in user space to a location relative to the path. The location is chosen so as to minimize the distance from the point to the path (e.g., the magnitude of the offset will be smallest). If there is more than one such location, the location with the smallest advance is chosen.

				</name>
				<description>
					Convert a location relative to the path to a point in user coordinates. The path might bend abruptly or be disjoint at the location's advance. If this is the case, the value of 'preceding' is used to disambiguate the portion of the path whose location and slope is to be used to interpret the offset.
