		<description>
			A representation of the SOAP header element. A SOAP header element consists of XML data that affects the way the application-specific content is processed by the message provider. For example, transaction semantics, authentication information, and so on, can be specified as the content of a SOAPHeader object. A SOAPEnvelope object contains an empty SOAPHeader object by default. If the SOAPHeader object, which is optional, is not needed, it can be retrieved and deleted with the following line of code. The variable se is a SOAPEnvelope object.         se.getHeader().detachNode();   A SOAPHeader object is created with the SOAPEnvelope method addHeader. This method, which creates a new header and adds it to the envelope, may be called only after the existing header has been removed.         se.getHeader().detachNode();        SOAPHeader sh = se.addHeader();   A SOAPHeader object can have only SOAPHeaderElement objects as its immediate children. The method addHeaderElement creates a new HeaderElement object and adds it to the SOAPHeader object. In the following line of code, the argument to the method addHeaderElement is a Name object that is the name for the new HeaderElement object.         SOAPHeaderElement shElement = sh.addHeaderElement(name);

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Iterator examineMustUnderstandHeaderElements(String actor)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an Iterator over all the SOAPHeaderElement objects in this SOAPHeader object that have the specified actor and that have a MustUnderstand attribute whose value is equivalent to true. In SOAP 1.2 the env:actor attribute is replaced by the env:role attribute, but with essentially the same semantics.

			<method>
				<name>
					Iterator examineHeaderElements(String actor)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an Iterator over all the SOAPHeaderElement objects in this SOAPHeader object that have the specified actor. An actor is a global attribute that indicates the intermediate parties that should process a message before it reaches its ultimate receiver. An actor receives the message and processes it before sending it on to the next actor. The default actor is the ultimate intended recipient for the message, so if no actor attribute is included in a SOAPHeader object, it is sent to the ultimate receiver along with the message body. In SOAP 1.2 the env:actor attribute is replaced by the env:role attribute, but with essentially the same semantics.

				<name>
					Iterator extractHeaderElements(String actor)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an Iterator over all the SOAPHeaderElement objects in this SOAPHeader object that have the specified actor and detaches them from this SOAPHeader object. This method allows an actor to process the parts of the SOAPHeader object that apply to it and to remove them before passing the message on to the next actor. In SOAP 1.2 the env:actor attribute is replaced by the env:role attribute, but with essentially the same semantics.
