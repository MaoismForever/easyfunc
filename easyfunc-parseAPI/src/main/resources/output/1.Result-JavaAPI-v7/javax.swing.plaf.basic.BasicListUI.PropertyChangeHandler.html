		<description>
			The PropertyChangeListener that's added to the JList at installUI time. When the value of a JList property that affects layout changes, we set a bit in updateLayoutStateNeeded. If the JLists model changes we additionally remove our listeners from the old model. Likewise for the JList selectionModel. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
