		<description>
			UIManager manages the current look and feel, the set of available look and feels, PropertyChangeListeners that are notified when the look and feel changes, look and feel defaults, and convenience methods for obtaining various default values. Specifying the look and feel The look and feel can be specified in two distinct ways: by specifying the fully qualified name of the class for the look and feel, or by creating an instance of LookAndFeel and passing it to setLookAndFeel. The following example illustrates setting the look and feel to the system look and feel:      UIManager.setLookAndFeel(UIManager.getSystemLookAndFeelClassName());   The following example illustrates setting the look and feel based on class name:      UIManager.setLookAndFeel("javax.swing.plaf.metal.MetalLookAndFeel");   Once the look and feel has been changed it is imperative to invoke updateUI on all JComponents. The method SwingUtilities.updateComponentTreeUI(java.awt.Component) makes it easy to apply updateUI to a containment hierarchy. Refer to it for details. The exact behavior of not invoking updateUI after changing the look and feel is unspecified. It is very possible to receive unexpected exceptions, painting problems, or worse. Default look and feel The class used for the default look and feel is chosen in the following manner: If the system property swing.defaultlaf is non-null, use its value as the default look and feel class name. If the Properties file swing.properties exists and contains the key swing.defaultlaf, use its value as the default look and feel class name. The location that is checked for swing.properties may vary depending upon the implementation of the Java platform. In Sun's implementation the location is ${java.home}/lib/swing.properties. Refer to the release notes of the implementation being used for further details. Otherwise use the cross platform look and feel. Defaults UIManager manages three sets of UIDefaults. In order, they are: Developer defaults. With few exceptions Swing does not alter the developer defaults; these are intended to be modified and used by the developer. Look and feel defaults. The look and feel defaults are supplied by the look and feel at the time it is installed as the current look and feel (setLookAndFeel() is invoked). The look and feel defaults can be obtained using the getLookAndFeelDefaults() method. Sytem defaults. The system defaults are provided by Swing. Invoking any of the various get methods results in checking each of the defaults, in order, returning the first non-null value. For example, invoking UIManager.getString("Table.foreground") results in first checking developer defaults. If the developer defaults contain a value for "Table.foreground" it is returned, otherwise the look and feel defaults are checked, followed by the system defaults. It's important to note that getDefaults returns a custom instance of UIDefaults with this resolution logic built into it. For example, UIManager.getDefaults().getString("Table.foreground") is equivalent to UIManager.getString("Table.foreground"). Both resolve using the algorithm just described. In many places the documentation uses the word defaults to refer to the custom instance of UIDefaults with the resolution logic as previously described. When the look and feel is changed, UIManager alters only the look and feel defaults; the developer and system defaults are not altered by the UIManager in any way. The set of defaults a particular look and feel supports is defined and documented by that look and feel. In addition, each look and feel, or ComponentUI provided by a look and feel, may access the defaults at different times in their life cycle. Some look and feels may agressively look up defaults, so that changing a default may not have an effect after installing the look and feel. Other look and feels may lazily access defaults so that a change to the defaults may effect an existing look and feel. Finally, other look and feels might not configure themselves from the defaults table in any way. None-the-less it is usually the case that a look and feel expects certain defaults, so that in general a ComponentUI provided by one look and feel will not work with another look and feel. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static UIManager.LookAndFeelInfo[] getInstalledLookAndFeels()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of LookAndFeelInfos representing the LookAndFeel implementations currently available. The LookAndFeelInfo objects can be used by an application to construct a menu of look and feel options for the user, or to determine which look and feel to set at startup time. To avoid the penalty of creating numerous LookAndFeel objects, LookAndFeelInfo maintains the class name of the LookAndFeel class, not the actual LookAndFeel instance. The following example illustrates setting the current look and feel from an instance of LookAndFeelInfo:      UIManager.setLookAndFeel(info.getClassName());

					Sets the set of available look and feels. While this method does not check to ensure all of the LookAndFeelInfos are non-null, it is strongly recommended that only non-null values are supplied in the infos array.

					public static void setLookAndFeel(LookAndFeel newLookAndFeel)                             throws UnsupportedLookAndFeelException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the current look and feel to newLookAndFeel. If the current look and feel is non-null uninitialize is invoked on it. If newLookAndFeel is non-null, initialize is invoked on it followed by getDefaults. The defaults returned from newLookAndFeel.getDefaults() replace those of the defaults from the previous look and feel. If the newLookAndFeel is null, the look and feel defaults are set to null. A value of null can be used to set the look and feel to null. As the LookAndFeel is required for most of Swing to function, setting the LookAndFeel to null is strongly discouraged. This is a JavaBeans bound property.

				<description>
					Returns the UIDefaults from the current look and feel, that were obtained at the time the look and feel was installed. In general, developers should use the UIDefaults returned from getDefaults(). As the current look and feel may expect certain values to exist, altering the UIDefaults returned from this method could have unexpected results.

					Adds a LookAndFeel to the list of auxiliary look and feels. The auxiliary look and feels tell the multiplexing look and feel what other LookAndFeel classes for a component instance are to be used in addition to the default LookAndFeel class when creating a multiplexing UI. The change will only take effect when a new UI class is created or when the default look and feel is changed on a component instance. Note these are not the same as the installed look and feels.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static boolean removeAuxiliaryLookAndFeel(LookAndFeel laf)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes a LookAndFeel from the list of auxiliary look and feels. The auxiliary look and feels tell the multiplexing look and feel what other LookAndFeel classes for a component instance are to be used in addition to the default LookAndFeel class when creating a multiplexing UI. The change will only take effect when a new UI class is created or when the default look and feel is changed on a component instance. Note these are not the same as the installed look and feels.

				<description>
					Returns the list of auxiliary look and feels (can be null).
