			XPath provides access to the XPath evaluation environment and expressions. Evaluation of XPath Expressions. context If a request is made to evaluate the expression in the absence of a context item, an empty document node will be used for the context. For the purposes of evaluating XPath expressions, a DocumentFragment is treated like a Document node. variables If the expression contains a variable reference, its value will be found through the XPathVariableResolver set with setXPathVariableResolver(XPathVariableResolver resolver). An XPathExpressionException is raised if the variable resolver is undefined or the resolver returns null for the variable. The value of a variable must be immutable through the course of any single evaluation. functions If the expression contains a function reference, the function will be found through the XPathFunctionResolver set with setXPathFunctionResolver(XPathFunctionResolver resolver). An XPathExpressionException is raised if the function resolver is undefined or the function resolver returns null for the function. QNames QNames in the expression are resolved against the XPath namespace context set with setNamespaceContext(NamespaceContext nsContext). result This result of evaluating an expression is converted to an instance of the desired return type. Valid return types are defined in XPathConstants. Conversion to the return type follows XPath conversion rules. An XPath object is not thread-safe and not reentrant. In other words, it is the application's responsibility to make sure that one XPath object is not used from more than one thread at any given time, and while the evaluate method is invoked, applications may not recursively call the evaluate method.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					void reset()
				</name>
				<description>
					Reset this XPath to its original configuration. XPath is reset to the same state as when it was created with XPathFactory.newXPath(). reset() is designed to allow the reuse of existing XPaths thus saving resources associated with the creation of new XPaths. The reset XPath is not guaranteed to have the same XPathFunctionResolver, XPathVariableResolver or NamespaceContext Objects, e.g. Object.equals(Object obj). It is guaranteed to have a functionally equal XPathFunctionResolver, XPathVariableResolver and NamespaceContext.

			<method>
				<name>
					XPathExpression compile(String expression)                          throws XPathExpressionException
				</name>
				<description>
					Compile an XPath expression for later evaluation. If expression contains any XPathFunctions, they must be available via the XPathFunctionResolver. An XPathExpressionException will be thrown if the XPathFunction cannot be resovled with the XPathFunctionResolver. If expression contains any variables, the XPathVariableResolver in effect at compile time will be used to resolve them. If expression is null, a NullPointerException is thrown.

					Object evaluate(String expression,                Object item,                QName returnType)                  throws XPathExpressionException
				</name>
				<description>
					Evaluate an XPath expression in the specified context and return the result as the specified type. See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. If returnType is not one of the types defined in XPathConstants ( NUMBER, STRING, BOOLEAN, NODE or NODESET) then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. If a null value is provided for item, an empty document will be used for the context. If expression or returnType is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown.

					String evaluate(String expression,                Object item)                  throws XPathExpressionException
				</name>
				<description>
					Evaluate an XPath expression in the specified context and return the result as a String. This method calls evaluate(String expression, Object item, QName returnType) with a returnType of XPathConstants.STRING. See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. If a null value is provided for item, an empty document will be used for the context. If expression is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown.

				</name>
				<description>
					Evaluate an XPath expression in the context of the specified InputSource and return the result as the specified type. This method builds a data model for the InputSource and calls evaluate(String expression, Object item, QName returnType) on the resulting document object. See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. If returnType is not one of the types defined in XPathConstants, then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. If expression, source or returnType is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown.

					Evaluate an XPath expression in the context of the specified InputSource and return the result as a String. This method calls evaluate(String expression, InputSource source, QName returnType) with a returnType of XPathConstants.STRING. See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. If expression or source is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown.
