		</name>
		<description>
			The CubicCurve2D class defines a cubic parametric curve segment in (x,y) coordinate space. This class is only the abstract superclass for all objects which store a 2D cubic curve segment. The actual storage representation of the coordinates is left to the subclass.

				<description>
					Subdivides the cubic curve specified by the coordinates stored in the src array at indices srcoff through (srcoff + 7) and stores the resulting two subdivided curves into the two result arrays at the corresponding indices. Either or both of the left and right arrays may be null or a reference to the same array as the src array. Note that the last point in the first subdivided curve is the same as the first point in the second subdivided curve. Thus, it is possible to pass the same array for left and right and to use offsets, such as rightoff equals (leftoff + 6), in order to avoid allocating extra storage for this common point.

				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the interior of the Shape intersects the interior of a specified rectangular area. The rectangular area is considered to intersect the Shape if any point is contained in both the interior of the Shape and the specified rectangular area. The Shape.intersects() method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return true when: there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the Shape intersect, but the calculations to accurately determine this intersection are prohibitively expensive. This means that for some Shapes this method might return true even though the rectangular area does not intersect the Shape. The Area class performs more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required.

				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the interior of the Shape entirely contains the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside the rectangular area must lie within the Shape for the entire rectanglar area to be considered contained within the Shape. The Shape.contains() method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return false when: the intersect method returns true and the calculations to determine whether or not the Shape entirely contains the rectangular area are prohibitively expensive. This means that for some Shapes this method might return false even though the Shape contains the rectangular area. The Area class performs more accurate geometric computations than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required.

					public Rectangle getBounds()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an integer Rectangle that completely encloses the Shape. Note that there is no guarantee that the returned Rectangle is the smallest bounding box that encloses the Shape, only that the Shape lies entirely within the indicated Rectangle. The returned Rectangle might also fail to completely enclose the Shape if the Shape overflows the limited range of the integer data type. The getBounds2D method generally returns a tighter bounding box due to its greater flexibility in representation. Note that the definition of insideness can lead to situations where points on the defining outline of the shape may not be considered contained in the returned bounds object, but only in cases where those points are also not considered contained in the original shape. If a point is inside the shape according to the contains(point) method, then it must be inside the returned Rectangle bounds object according to the contains(point) method of the bounds. Specifically: shape.contains(x,y) requires bounds.contains(x,y) If a point is not inside the shape, then it might still be contained in the bounds object: bounds.contains(x,y) does not imply shape.contains(x,y)
