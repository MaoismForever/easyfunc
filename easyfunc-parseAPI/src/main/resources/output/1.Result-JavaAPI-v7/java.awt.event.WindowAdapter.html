			public abstract class WindowAdapter  extends Object  implements WindowListener, WindowStateListener, WindowFocusListener
		</name>
		<description>
			An abstract adapter class for receiving window events. The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as convenience for creating listener objects. Extend this class to create a WindowEvent listener and override the methods for the events of interest. (If you implement the WindowListener interface, you have to define all of the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.) Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with a Window using the window's addWindowListener method. When the window's status changes by virtue of being opened, closed, activated or deactivated, iconified or deiconified, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and the WindowEvent is passed to it.
