				<description>
					Instantiates and registers an MBean in the MBean server. The MBean server will use its Default Loader Repository to load the class of the MBean. An object name is associated with the MBean. If the object name given is null, the MBean must provide its own name by implementing the MBeanRegistration interface and returning the name from the preRegister method. This method is equivalent to createMBean(className, name, (Object[]) null, (String[]) null).

					Gets MBeans controlled by the MBean server. This method allows any of the following to be obtained: All MBeans, a set of MBeans specified by pattern matching on the ObjectName and/or a Query expression, a specific MBean. When the object name is null or no domain and key properties are specified, all objects are to be selected (and filtered if a query is specified). It returns the set of ObjectInstance objects (containing the ObjectName and the Java Class name) for the selected MBeans.

				<description>
					Retrieves the values of several attributes of a named MBean. The MBean is identified by its object name. If one or more attributes cannot be retrieved for some reason, they will be omitted from the returned AttributeList. The caller should check that the list is the same size as the attributes array. To discover what problem prevented a given attribute from being retrieved, call getAttribute for that attribute. Here is an example of calling this method and checking that it succeeded in retrieving all the requested attributes:    String[] attrNames = ...;   AttributeList list = mbeanServerConnection.getAttributes(objectName, attrNames);   if (list.size() == attrNames.length)       System.out.println("All attributes were retrieved successfully");   else {       List<String> missing = new ArrayList<String>(Arrays.asList(attrNames));       for (Attribute a : list.asList())           missing.remove(a.getName());       System.out.println("Did not retrieve: " + missing);   }

				<description>
					Sets the values of several attributes of a named MBean. The MBean is identified by its object name. If one or more attributes cannot be set for some reason, they will be omitted from the returned AttributeList. The caller should check that the input AttributeList is the same size as the output one. To discover what problem prevented a given attribute from being retrieved, it will usually be possible to call setAttribute for that attribute, although this is not guaranteed to work. (For example, the values of two attributes may have been rejected because they were inconsistent with each other. Setting one of them alone might be allowed.) Here is an example of calling this method and checking that it succeeded in setting all the requested attributes:    AttributeList inputAttrs = ...;   AttributeList outputAttrs = mbeanServerConnection.setAttributes(objectName, inputAttrs);   if (inputAttrs.size() == outputAttrs.size())       System.out.println("All attributes were set successfully");   else {       List<String> missing = new ArrayList<String>();       for (Attribute a : inputAttrs.asList())           missing.add(a.getName());       for (Attribute a : outputAttrs.asList())           missing.remove(a.getName());       System.out.println("Did not set: " + missing);   }

				</name>
				<description>
					Invokes an operation on an MBean. Because of the need for a signature to differentiate possibly-overloaded operations, it is much simpler to invoke operations through an MBean proxy where possible. For example, suppose you have a Standard MBean interface like this:    public interface FooMBean {       public int countMatches(String[] patterns, boolean ignoreCase);   }   The countMatches operation can be invoked as follows:    String[] myPatterns = ...;   int count = (Integer) mbeanServerConnection.invoke(           objectName,           "countMatches",           new Object[] {myPatterns, true},           new String[] {String[].class.getName(), boolean.class.getName()});   Alternatively, it can be invoked through a proxy as follows:    String[] myPatterns = ...;   FooMBean fooProxy = JMX.newMBeanProxy(           mbeanServerConnection, objectName, FooMBean.class);   int count = fooProxy.countMatches(myPatterns, true);

				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a listener to a registered MBean. A notification emitted by an MBean will be forwarded by the MBeanServer to the listener. If the source of the notification is a reference to an MBean object, the MBean server will replace it by that MBean's ObjectName. Otherwise the source is unchanged. The listener object that receives notifications is the one that is registered with the given name at the time this method is called. Even if it is subsequently unregistered, it will continue to receive notifications.
