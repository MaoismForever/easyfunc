			File manager based on java.io.File. A common way to obtain an instance of this class is using getStandardFileManager, for example:      JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();     DiagnosticCollector<JavaFileObject> diagnostics =         new DiagnosticCollector<JavaFileObject>();     StandardJavaFileManager fm = compiler.getStandardFileManager(diagnostics, null, null);   This file manager creates file objects representing regular files, zip file entries, or entries in similar file system based containers. Any file object returned from a file manager implementing this interface must observe the following behavior: File names need not be canonical. For file objects representing regular files the method FileObject.delete() is equivalent to File.delete(), the method FileObject.getLastModified() is equivalent to File.lastModified(), the methods FileObject.getCharContent(boolean), FileObject.openInputStream(), and FileObject.openReader(boolean) must succeed if the following would succeed (ignoring encoding issues): new FileInputStream(new File(fileObject.toUri())) and the methods FileObject.openOutputStream(), and FileObject.openWriter() must succeed if the following would succeed (ignoring encoding issues): new FileOutputStream(new File(fileObject.toUri())) The URI returned from FileObject.toUri() must be absolute (have a schema), and must have a normalized path component which can be resolved without any process-specific context such as the current directory (file names must be absolute). According to these rules, the following URIs, for example, are allowed: file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/UncleBob/BobsApp/Test.java jar:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/UncleBob/lib/vendorA.jar!com/vendora/LibraryClass.class Whereas these are not (reason in parentheses): file:BobsApp/Test.java (the file name is relative and depend on the current directory) jar:lib/vendorA.jar!com/vendora/LibraryClass.class (the first half of the path depends on the current directory, whereas the component after ! is legal) Test.java (this URI depends on the current directory and does not have a schema) jar:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/UncleBob/BobsApp/../lib/vendorA.jar!com/vendora/LibraryClass.class (the path is not normalized)
