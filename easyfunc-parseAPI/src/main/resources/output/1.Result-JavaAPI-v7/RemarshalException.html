			public final class RemarshalException  extends Exception
		</name>
		<description>
			This class is used for reporting locate forward exceptions and object forward GIOP messages back to the ORB. In this case the ORB must remarshal the request before trying again. Stubs which use the stream-based model shall catch the RemarshalException which is potentially thrown from the _invoke() method of ObjectImpl. Upon catching the exception, the stub shall immediately remarshal the request by calling _request(), marshalling the arguments (if any), and then calling _invoke(). The stub shall repeat this process until _invoke() returns normally or raises some exception other than RemarshalException.
