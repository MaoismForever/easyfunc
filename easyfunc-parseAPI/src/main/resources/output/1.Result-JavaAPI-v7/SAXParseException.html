			public class SAXParseException  extends SAXException
		</name>
		<description>
			Encapsulate an XML parse error or warning. This module, both source code and documentation, is in the Public Domain, and comes with NO WARRANTY. See http://www.saxproject.org for further information. This exception may include information for locating the error in the original XML document, as if it came from a Locator object. Note that although the application will receive a SAXParseException as the argument to the handlers in the ErrorHandler interface, the application is not actually required to throw the exception; instead, it can simply read the information in it and take a different action. Since this exception is a subclass of SAXException, it inherits the ability to wrap another exception.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public SAXParseException(String message,                   Locator locator)
				</name>
				<description>
					Create a new SAXParseException from a message and a Locator. This constructor is especially useful when an application is creating its own exception from within a ContentHandler callback.
				</description>
				
			</method>

					public SAXParseException(String message,                   Locator locator,                   Exception e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Wrap an existing exception in a SAXParseException. This constructor is especially useful when an application is creating its own exception from within a ContentHandler callback, and needs to wrap an existing exception that is not a subclass of SAXException.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public SAXParseException(String message,                   String publicId,                   String systemId,                   int lineNumber,                   int columnNumber)
				</name>
				<description>
					Create a new SAXParseException. This constructor is most useful for parser writers. All parameters except the message are as if they were provided by a Locator. For example, if the system identifier is a URL (including relative filename), the caller must resolve it fully before creating the exception.

					public SAXParseException(String message,                   String publicId,                   String systemId,                   int lineNumber,                   int columnNumber,                   Exception e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Create a new SAXParseException with an embedded exception. This constructor is most useful for parser writers who need to wrap an exception that is not a subclass of SAXException. All parameters except the message and exception are as if they were provided by a Locator. For example, if the system identifier is a URL (including relative filename), the caller must resolve it fully before creating the exception.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getPublicId()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the public identifier of the entity where the exception occurred.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getSystemId()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the system identifier of the entity where the exception occurred. If the system identifier is a URL, it will have been resolved fully.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getLineNumber()
				</name>
				<description>
					The line number of the end of the text where the exception occurred. The first line is line 1.

			<method>
				<name>
					public int getColumnNumber()
				</name>
				<description>
					The column number of the end of the text where the exception occurred. The first column in a line is position 1.

					public String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Override toString to provide more detailed error message.
