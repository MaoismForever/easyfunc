			public class DefaultHandler  extends Object  implements EntityResolver, DTDHandler, ContentHandler, ErrorHandler
		</name>
		<description>
			Default base class for SAX2 event handlers. This module, both source code and documentation, is in the Public Domain, and comes with NO WARRANTY. See http://www.saxproject.org for further information. This class is available as a convenience base class for SAX2 applications: it provides default implementations for all of the callbacks in the four core SAX2 handler classes: EntityResolver DTDHandler ContentHandler ErrorHandler Application writers can extend this class when they need to implement only part of an interface; parser writers can instantiate this class to provide default handlers when the application has not supplied its own. This class replaces the deprecated SAX1 HandlerBase class.

				</name>
				<description>
					Resolve an external entity. Always return null, so that the parser will use the system identifier provided in the XML document. This method implements the SAX default behaviour: application writers can override it in a subclass to do special translations such as catalog lookups or URI redirection.

				</name>
				<description>
					Receive notification of a parser warning. The default implementation does nothing. Application writers may override this method in a subclass to take specific actions for each warning, such as inserting the message in a log file or printing it to the console.

				</name>
				<description>
					Report a fatal XML parsing error. The default implementation throws a SAXParseException. Application writers may override this method in a subclass if they need to take specific actions for each fatal error (such as collecting all of the errors into a single report): in any case, the application must stop all regular processing when this method is invoked, since the document is no longer reliable, and the parser may no longer report parsing events.
