		<description>
			The mapping in the JavaTM programming language for the SQL CLOB type. An SQL CLOB is a built-in type that stores a Character Large Object as a column value in a row of a database table. By default drivers implement a Clob object using an SQL locator(CLOB), which means that a Clob object contains a logical pointer to the SQL CLOB data rather than the data itself. A Clob object is valid for the duration of the transaction in which it was created. The Clob interface provides methods for getting the length of an SQL CLOB (Character Large Object) value, for materializing a CLOB value on the client, and for searching for a substring or CLOB object within a CLOB value. Methods in the interfaces ResultSet, CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as getClob and setClob allow a programmer to access an SQL CLOB value. In addition, this interface has methods for updating a CLOB value. All methods on the Clob interface must be fully implemented if the JDBC driver supports the data type.

					String getSubString(long pos,                    int length)                      throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves a copy of the specified substring in the CLOB value designated by this Clob object. The substring begins at position pos and has up to length consecutive characters.

					Reader getCharacterStream()                            throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the CLOB value designated by this Clob object as a java.io.Reader object (or as a stream of characters).

				<name>
					InputStream getAsciiStream()                             throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the CLOB value designated by this Clob object as an ascii stream.

				<name>
					long position(String searchstr,              long start)                throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the character position at which the specified substring searchstr appears in the SQL CLOB value represented by this Clob object. The search begins at position start.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					long position(Clob searchstr,              long start)                throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the character position at which the specified Clob object searchstr appears in this Clob object. The search begins at position start.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int setString(long pos,              String str)                throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Writes the given Java String to the CLOB value that this Clob object designates at the position pos. The string will overwrite the existing characters in the Clob object starting at the position pos. If the end of the Clob value is reached while writing the given string, then the length of the Clob value will be increased to accomodate the extra characters. Note: If the value specified for pos is greater then the length+1 of the CLOB value then the behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw a SQLException while other drivers may support this operation.

					int setString(long pos,              String str,              int offset,              int len)                throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Writes len characters of str, starting at character offset, to the CLOB value that this Clob represents. The string will overwrite the existing characters in the Clob object starting at the position pos. If the end of the Clob value is reached while writing the given string, then the length of the Clob value will be increased to accomodate the extra characters. Note: If the value specified for pos is greater then the length+1 of the CLOB value then the behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw a SQLException while other drivers may support this operation.

				<name>
					OutputStream setAsciiStream(long pos)                              throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves a stream to be used to write Ascii characters to the CLOB value that this Clob object represents, starting at position pos. Characters written to the stream will overwrite the existing characters in the Clob object starting at the position pos. If the end of the Clob value is reached while writing characters to the stream, then the length of the Clob value will be increased to accomodate the extra characters. Note: If the value specified for pos is greater then the length+1 of the CLOB value then the behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw a SQLException while other drivers may support this operation.

			<method>
				<name>
					Writer setCharacterStream(long pos)                            throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves a stream to be used to write a stream of Unicode characters to the CLOB value that this Clob object represents, at position pos. Characters written to the stream will overwrite the existing characters in the Clob object starting at the position pos. If the end of the Clob value is reached while writing characters to the stream, then the length of the Clob value will be increased to accomodate the extra characters. Note: If the value specified for pos is greater then the length+1 of the CLOB value then the behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw a SQLException while other drivers may support this operation.

			<method>
				<name>
					void truncate(long len)                throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Truncates the CLOB value that this Clob designates to have a length of len characters. Note: If the value specified for pos is greater then the length+1 of the CLOB value then the behavior is undefined. Some JDBC drivers may throw a SQLException while other drivers may support this operation.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void free()            throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					This method frees the Clob object and releases the resources the resources that it holds. The object is invalid once the free method is called. After free has been called, any attempt to invoke a method other than free will result in a SQLException being thrown. If free is called multiple times, the subsequent calls to free are treated as a no-op.

			<method>
				<name>
					Reader getCharacterStream(long pos,                          long length)                            throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Reader object that contains a partial Clob value, starting with the character specified by pos, which is length characters in length.
