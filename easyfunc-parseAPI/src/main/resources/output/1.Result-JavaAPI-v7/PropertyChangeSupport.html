		</name>
		<description>
			This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support bound properties. It manages a list of listeners and dispatches PropertyChangeEvents to them. You can use an instance of this class as a member field of your bean and delegate these types of work to it. The PropertyChangeListener can be registered for all properties or for a property specified by name. Here is an example of PropertyChangeSupport usage that follows the rules and recommendations laid out in the JavaBeans™ specification:    public class MyBean {       private final PropertyChangeSupport pcs = new PropertyChangeSupport(this);         public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {           this.pcs.addPropertyChangeListener(listener);       }         public void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {           this.pcs.removePropertyChangeListener(listener);       }         private String value;         public String getValue() {           return this.value;       }         public void setValue(String newValue) {           String oldValue = this.value;           this.value = newValue;           this.pcs.firePropertyChange("value", oldValue, newValue);       }         [...]   }   A PropertyChangeSupport instance is thread-safe. This class is serializable. When it is serialized it will save (and restore) any listeners that are themselves serializable. Any non-serializable listeners will be skipped during serialization.

			<method>
				<name>
					public PropertyChangeSupport(Object sourceBean)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a PropertyChangeSupport object.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener)
				</name>
				<description>
					Add a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list. The listener is registered for all properties. The same listener object may be added more than once, and will be called as many times as it is added. If listener is null, no exception is thrown and no action is taken.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener)
				</name>
				<description>
					Remove a PropertyChangeListener from the listener list. This removes a PropertyChangeListener that was registered for all properties. If listener was added more than once to the same event source, it will be notified one less time after being removed. If listener is null, or was never added, no exception is thrown and no action is taken.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public PropertyChangeListener[] getPropertyChangeListeners()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of all the listeners that were added to the PropertyChangeSupport object with addPropertyChangeListener(). If some listeners have been added with a named property, then the returned array will be a mixture of PropertyChangeListeners and PropertyChangeListenerProxys. If the calling method is interested in distinguishing the listeners then it must test each element to see if it's a PropertyChangeListenerProxy, perform the cast, and examine the parameter.    PropertyChangeListener[] listeners = bean.getPropertyChangeListeners();   for (int i = 0; i < listeners.length; i++) {     if (listeners[i] instanceof PropertyChangeListenerProxy) {       PropertyChangeListenerProxy proxy =                      (PropertyChangeListenerProxy)listeners[i];       if (proxy.getPropertyName().equals("foo")) {         // proxy is a PropertyChangeListener which was associated         // with the property named "foo"       }     }   }

					public void addPropertyChangeListener(String propertyName,                               PropertyChangeListener listener)
				</name>
				<description>
					Add a PropertyChangeListener for a specific property. The listener will be invoked only when a call on firePropertyChange names that specific property. The same listener object may be added more than once. For each property, the listener will be invoked the number of times it was added for that property. If propertyName or listener is null, no exception is thrown and no action is taken.

				<description>
					Remove a PropertyChangeListener for a specific property. If listener was added more than once to the same event source for the specified property, it will be notified one less time after being removed. If propertyName is null, no exception is thrown and no action is taken. If listener is null, or was never added for the specified property, no exception is thrown and no action is taken.

				</name>
				<description>
					Reports a bound property update to listeners that have been registered to track updates of all properties or a property with the specified name. No event is fired if old and new values are equal and non-null. This is merely a convenience wrapper around the more general firePropertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent) method.

				<description>
					Reports an integer bound property update to listeners that have been registered to track updates of all properties or a property with the specified name. No event is fired if old and new values are equal. This is merely a convenience wrapper around the more general firePropertyChange(String, Object, Object) method.

				<description>
					Reports a boolean bound property update to listeners that have been registered to track updates of all properties or a property with the specified name.
