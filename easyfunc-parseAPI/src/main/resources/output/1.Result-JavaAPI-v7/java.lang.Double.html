		<description>
			The Double class wraps a value of the primitive type double in an object. An object of type Double contains a single field whose type is double. In addition, this class provides several methods for converting a double to a String and a String to a double, as well as other constants and methods useful when dealing with a double.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static String toString(double d)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of the double argument. All characters mentioned below are ASCII characters. If the argument is NaN, the result is the string "NaN". Otherwise, the result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude (absolute value) of the argument. If the sign is negative, the first character of the result is '-' ('\u002D'); if the sign is positive, no sign character appears in the result. As for the magnitude m: If m is infinity, it is represented by the characters "Infinity"; thus, positive infinity produces the result "Infinity" and negative infinity produces the result "-Infinity". If m is zero, it is represented by the characters "0.0"; thus, negative zero produces the result "-0.0" and positive zero produces the result "0.0". If m is greater than or equal to 10-3 but less than 107, then it is represented as the integer part of m, in decimal form with no leading zeroes, followed by '.' ('\u002E'), followed by one or more decimal digits representing the fractional part of m. If m is less than 10-3 or greater than or equal to 107, then it is represented in so-called "computerized scientific notation." Let n be the unique integer such that 10n ? m < 10n+1; then let a be the mathematically exact quotient of m and 10n so that 1 ? a < 10. The magnitude is then represented as the integer part of a, as a single decimal digit, followed by '.' ('\u002E'), followed by decimal digits representing the fractional part of a, followed by the letter 'E' ('\u0045'), followed by a representation of n as a decimal integer, as produced by the method Integer.toString(int). How many digits must be printed for the fractional part of m or a? There must be at least one digit to represent the fractional part, and beyond that as many, but only as many, more digits as are needed to uniquely distinguish the argument value from adjacent values of type double. That is, suppose that x is the exact mathematical value represented by the decimal representation produced by this method for a finite nonzero argument d. Then d must be the double value nearest to x; or if two double values are equally close to x, then d must be one of them and the least significant bit of the significand of d must be 0. To create localized string representations of a floating-point value, use subclasses of NumberFormat.

				<name>
					public static String toHexString(double d)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a hexadecimal string representation of the double argument. All characters mentioned below are ASCII characters. If the argument is NaN, the result is the string "NaN". Otherwise, the result is a string that represents the sign and magnitude of the argument. If the sign is negative, the first character of the result is '-' ('\u002D'); if the sign is positive, no sign character appears in the result. As for the magnitude m: If m is infinity, it is represented by the string "Infinity"; thus, positive infinity produces the result "Infinity" and negative infinity produces the result "-Infinity". If m is zero, it is represented by the string "0x0.0p0"; thus, negative zero produces the result "-0x0.0p0" and positive zero produces the result "0x0.0p0". If m is a double value with a normalized representation, substrings are used to represent the significand and exponent fields. The significand is represented by the characters "0x1." followed by a lowercase hexadecimal representation of the rest of the significand as a fraction. Trailing zeros in the hexadecimal representation are removed unless all the digits are zero, in which case a single zero is used. Next, the exponent is represented by "p" followed by a decimal string of the unbiased exponent as if produced by a call to Integer.toString on the exponent value. If m is a double value with a subnormal representation, the significand is represented by the characters "0x0." followed by a hexadecimal representation of the rest of the significand as a fraction. Trailing zeros in the hexadecimal representation are removed. Next, the exponent is represented by "p-1022". Note that there must be at least one nonzero digit in a subnormal significand. Examples Floating-point Value Hexadecimal String 1.0 0x1.0p0 -1.0 -0x1.0p0 2.0 0x1.0p1 3.0 0x1.8p1 0.5 0x1.0p-1 0.25 0x1.0p-2 Double.MAX_VALUE 0x1.fffffffffffffp1023 Minimum Normal Value 0x1.0p-1022 Maximum Subnormal Value 0x0.fffffffffffffp-1022 Double.MIN_VALUE 0x0.0000000000001p-1022

					public static Double valueOf(String s)                        throws NumberFormatException
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Double object holding the double value represented by the argument string s. If s is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown. Leading and trailing whitespace characters in s are ignored. Whitespace is removed as if by the String.trim() method; that is, both ASCII space and control characters are removed. The rest of s should constitute a FloatValue as described by the lexical syntax rules: FloatValue: Signopt NaN Signopt Infinity Signopt FloatingPointLiteral Signopt HexFloatingPointLiteral SignedInteger HexFloatingPointLiteral: HexSignificand BinaryExponent FloatTypeSuffixopt HexSignificand: HexNumeral HexNumeral . 0x HexDigitsopt . HexDigits 0X HexDigitsopt . HexDigits BinaryExponent: BinaryExponentIndicator SignedInteger BinaryExponentIndicator: p P where Sign, FloatingPointLiteral, HexNumeral, HexDigits, SignedInteger and FloatTypeSuffix are as defined in the lexical structure sections of The Java™ Language Specification, except that underscores are not accepted between digits. If s does not have the form of a FloatValue, then a NumberFormatException is thrown. Otherwise, s is regarded as representing an exact decimal value in the usual "computerized scientific notation" or as an exact hexadecimal value; this exact numerical value is then conceptually converted to an "infinitely precise" binary value that is then rounded to type double by the usual round-to-nearest rule of IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic, which includes preserving the sign of a zero value. Note that the round-to-nearest rule also implies overflow and underflow behaviour; if the exact value of s is large enough in magnitude (greater than or equal to (MAX_VALUE + ulp(MAX_VALUE)/2), rounding to double will result in an infinity and if the exact value of s is small enough in magnitude (less than or equal to MIN_VALUE/2), rounding to float will result in a zero. Finally, after rounding a Double object representing this double value is returned. To interpret localized string representations of a floating-point value, use subclasses of NumberFormat. Note that trailing format specifiers, specifiers that determine the type of a floating-point literal (1.0f is a float value; 1.0d is a double value), do not influence the results of this method. In other words, the numerical value of the input string is converted directly to the target floating-point type. The two-step sequence of conversions, string to float followed by float to double, is not equivalent to converting a string directly to double. For example, the float literal 0.1f is equal to the double value 0.10000000149011612; the float literal 0.1f represents a different numerical value than the double literal 0.1. (The numerical value 0.1 cannot be exactly represented in a binary floating-point number.) To avoid calling this method on an invalid string and having a NumberFormatException be thrown, the regular expression below can be used to screen the input string:     final String Digits     = "(\\p{Digit}+)";    final String HexDigits  = "(\\p{XDigit}+)";    // an exponent is 'e' or 'E' followed by an optionally    // signed decimal integer.    final String Exp        = "[eE][+-]?"+Digits;    final String fpRegex    =        ("[\\x00-\\x20]*"+  // Optional leading "whitespace"         "[+-]?(" + // Optional sign character         "NaN|" +           // "NaN" string         "Infinity|" +      // "Infinity" string           // A decimal floating-point string representing a finite positive         // number without a leading sign has at most five basic pieces:         // Digits . Digits ExponentPart FloatTypeSuffix         //         // Since this method allows integer-only strings as input         // in addition to strings of floating-point literals, the         // two sub-patterns below are simplifications of the grammar         // productions from section 3.10.2 of         // The Java™ Language Specification.           // Digits ._opt Digits_opt ExponentPart_opt FloatTypeSuffix_opt         "((("+Digits+"(\\.)?("+Digits+"?)("+Exp+")?)|"+           // . Digits ExponentPart_opt FloatTypeSuffix_opt         "(\\.("+Digits+")("+Exp+")?)|"+           // Hexadecimal strings         "((" +          // 0[xX] HexDigits ._opt BinaryExponent FloatTypeSuffix_opt          "(0[xX]" + HexDigits + "(\\.)?)|" +            // 0[xX] HexDigits_opt . HexDigits BinaryExponent FloatTypeSuffix_opt          "(0[xX]" + HexDigits + "?(\\.)" + HexDigits + ")" +            ")[pP][+-]?" + Digits + "))" +         "[fFdD]?))" +         "[\\x00-\\x20]*");// Optional trailing "whitespace"      if (Pattern.matches(fpRegex, myString))        Double.valueOf(myString); // Will not throw NumberFormatException    else {        // Perform suitable alternative action    }

The result is the exclusive OR of the two halves of the long integer bit representation, exactly as produced by the method doubleToLongBits(double), of the primitive double value represented by this Double object. That is, the hash code is the value of the expression: (int)(v^(v>>>32)) where v is defined by: long v = Double.doubleToLongBits(this.doubleValue());

				</name>
				<description>
					Compares this object against the specified object. The result is true if and only if the argument is not null and is a Double object that represents a double that has the same value as the double represented by this object. For this purpose, two double values are considered to be the same if and only if the method doubleToLongBits(double) returns the identical long value when applied to each. Note that in most cases, for two instances of class Double, d1 and d2, the value of d1.equals(d2) is true if and only if d1.doubleValue() == d2.doubleValue() also has the value true. However, there are two exceptions: If d1 and d2 both represent Double.NaN, then the equals method returns true, even though Double.NaN==Double.NaN has the value false. If d1 represents +0.0 while d2 represents -0.0, or vice versa, the equal test has the value false, even though +0.0==-0.0 has the value true. This definition allows hash tables to operate properly.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static long doubleToLongBits(double value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a representation of the specified floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 floating-point "double format" bit layout. Bit 63 (the bit that is selected by the mask 0x8000000000000000L) represents the sign of the floating-point number. Bits 62-52 (the bits that are selected by the mask 0x7ff0000000000000L) represent the exponent. Bits 51-0 (the bits that are selected by the mask 0x000fffffffffffffL) represent the significand (sometimes called the mantissa) of the floating-point number. If the argument is positive infinity, the result is 0x7ff0000000000000L. If the argument is negative infinity, the result is 0xfff0000000000000L. If the argument is NaN, the result is 0x7ff8000000000000L. In all cases, the result is a long integer that, when given to the longBitsToDouble(long) method, will produce a floating-point value the same as the argument to doubleToLongBits (except all NaN values are collapsed to a single "canonical" NaN value).

				<name>
					public static long doubleToRawLongBits(double value)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a representation of the specified floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 floating-point "double format" bit layout, preserving Not-a-Number (NaN) values. Bit 63 (the bit that is selected by the mask 0x8000000000000000L) represents the sign of the floating-point number. Bits 62-52 (the bits that are selected by the mask 0x7ff0000000000000L) represent the exponent. Bits 51-0 (the bits that are selected by the mask 0x000fffffffffffffL) represent the significand (sometimes called the mantissa) of the floating-point number. If the argument is positive infinity, the result is 0x7ff0000000000000L. If the argument is negative infinity, the result is 0xfff0000000000000L. If the argument is NaN, the result is the long integer representing the actual NaN value. Unlike the doubleToLongBits method, doubleToRawLongBits does not collapse all the bit patterns encoding a NaN to a single "canonical" NaN value. In all cases, the result is a long integer that, when given to the longBitsToDouble(long) method, will produce a floating-point value the same as the argument to doubleToRawLongBits.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static double longBitsToDouble(long bits)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the double value corresponding to a given bit representation. The argument is considered to be a representation of a floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 floating-point "double format" bit layout. If the argument is 0x7ff0000000000000L, the result is positive infinity. If the argument is 0xfff0000000000000L, the result is negative infinity. If the argument is any value in the range 0x7ff0000000000001L through 0x7fffffffffffffffL or in the range 0xfff0000000000001L through 0xffffffffffffffffL, the result is a NaN. No IEEE 754 floating-point operation provided by Java can distinguish between two NaN values of the same type with different bit patterns. Distinct values of NaN are only distinguishable by use of the Double.doubleToRawLongBits method. In all other cases, let s, e, and m be three values that can be computed from the argument:    int s = ((bits >> 63) == 0) ? 1 : -1;   int e = (int)((bits >> 52) & 0x7ffL);   long m = (e == 0) ?                   (bits & 0xfffffffffffffL) << 1 :                   (bits & 0xfffffffffffffL) | 0x10000000000000L;   Then the floating-point result equals the value of the mathematical expression s·m·2e-1075. Note that this method may not be able to return a double NaN with exactly same bit pattern as the long argument. IEEE 754 distinguishes between two kinds of NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs. The differences between the two kinds of NaN are generally not visible in Java. Arithmetic operations on signaling NaNs turn them into quiet NaNs with a different, but often similar, bit pattern. However, on some processors merely copying a signaling NaN also performs that conversion. In particular, copying a signaling NaN to return it to the calling method may perform this conversion. So longBitsToDouble may not be able to return a double with a signaling NaN bit pattern. Consequently, for some long values, doubleToRawLongBits(longBitsToDouble(start)) may not equal start. Moreover, which particular bit patterns represent signaling NaNs is platform dependent; although all NaN bit patterns, quiet or signaling, must be in the NaN range identified above.

					public int compareTo(Double anotherDouble)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares two Double objects numerically. There are two ways in which comparisons performed by this method differ from those performed by the Java language numerical comparison operators (<, <=, ==, >=, >) when applied to primitive double values: Double.NaN is considered by this method to be equal to itself and greater than all other double values (including Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY). 0.0d is considered by this method to be greater than -0.0d. This ensures that the natural ordering of Double objects imposed by this method is consistent with equals.
