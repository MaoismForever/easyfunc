		<description>
			The Holder for Int. For more information on Holder files, see "Generated Files: Holder Files". A Holder class for an int that is used to store "out" and "inout" parameters in IDL methods. If an IDL method signature has an IDL long as an "out" or "inout" parameter, the programmer must pass an instance of IntHolder as the corresponding parameter in the method invocation; for "inout" parameters, the programmer must also fill the "in" value to be sent to the server. Before the method invocation returns, the ORB will fill in the value corresponding to the "out" value returned from the server. If myIntHolder is an instance of IntHolder, the value stored in its value field can be accessed with myIntHolder.value.
