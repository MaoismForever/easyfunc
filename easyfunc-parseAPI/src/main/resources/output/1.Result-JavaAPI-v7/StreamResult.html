			public class StreamResult  extends Object  implements Result
		</name>
		<description>
			Acts as an holder for a transformation result, which may be XML, plain Text, HTML, or some other form of markup.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String FEATURE
				</name>
				<description>
					If TransformerFactory.getFeature(java.lang.String) returns true when passed this value as an argument, the Transformer supports Result output of this type.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StreamResult()
				</name>
				<description>
					Zero-argument default constructor.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StreamResult(OutputStream outputStream)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a StreamResult from a byte stream. Normally, a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that the transformer may use instructions contained in the transformation instructions to control the encoding.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StreamResult(Writer writer)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a StreamResult from a character stream. Normally, a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that the transformer may use instructions contained in the transformation instructions to control the encoding. However, there are times when it is useful to write to a character stream, such as when using a StringWriter.

			<method>
				<name>
					public StreamResult(String systemId)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a StreamResult from a URL.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public StreamResult(File f)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a StreamResult from a File.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setOutputStream(OutputStream outputStream)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the ByteStream that is to be written to. Normally, a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that the transformer may use instructions contained in the transformation instructions to control the encoding.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public OutputStream getOutputStream()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the byte stream that was set with setOutputStream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setWriter(Writer writer)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the writer that is to receive the result. Normally, a stream should be used rather than a writer, so that the transformer may use instructions contained in the transformation instructions to control the encoding. However, there are times when it is useful to write to a writer, such as when using a StringWriter.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Writer getWriter()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the character stream that was set with setWriter.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setSystemId(String systemId)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the systemID that may be used in association with the byte or character stream, or, if neither is set, use this value as a writeable URI (probably a file name).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setSystemId(File f)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the system ID from a File reference.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String getSystemId()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.
