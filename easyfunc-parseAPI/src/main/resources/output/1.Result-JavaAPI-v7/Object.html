			The definition for a CORBA object reference. A CORBA object reference is a handle for a particular CORBA object implemented by a server. A CORBA object reference identifies the same CORBA object each time the reference is used to invoke a method on the object. A CORBA object may have multiple, distinct object references. The org.omg.CORBA.Object interface is the root of the inheritance hierarchy for all CORBA object references in the Java programming language, analogous to java.rmi.Remote for RMI remote objects. A CORBA object may be either local or remote. If it is a local object (that is, running in the same VM as the client), invocations may be directly serviced by the object instance, and the object reference could point to the actual instance of the object implementation class. If a CORBA object is a remote object (that is, running in a different VM from the client), the object reference points to a stub (proxy) which uses the ORB machinery to make a remote invocation on the server where the object implementation resides. Default implementations of the methods in the interface org.omg.CORBA.Object are provided in the class org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl, which is the base class for stubs and object implementations.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean _is_a(String repositoryIdentifier)
				</name>
				<description>
					Checks whether this object is an instance of a class that implements the given interface.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean _is_equivalent(Object other)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether the two object references are equivalent, so far as the ORB can easily determine. Two object references are equivalent if they are identical. Two distinct object references which in fact refer to the same object are also equivalent. However, ORBs are not required to attempt determination of whether two distinct object references refer to the same object, since such determination could be impractically expensive.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean _non_existent()
				</name>
				<description>
					Determines whether the server object for this object reference has been destroyed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int _hash(int maximum)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an ORB-internal identifier for this object reference. This is a hash identifier, which does not change during the lifetime of the object reference, and so neither will any hash function of that identifier change. The value returned is not guaranteed to be unique; in other words, another object reference may have the same hash value. If two object references hash differently, then they are distinct object references; however, both may still refer to the same CORBA object.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Object _duplicate()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a duplicate of this CORBA object reference. The server object implementation is not involved in creating the duplicate, and the implementation cannot distinguish whether the original object reference or a duplicate was used to make a request. Note that this method is not very useful in the Java platform, since memory management is handled by the VM. It is included for compliance with the CORBA APIs. The method _duplicate may return this object reference itself.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void _release()
				</name>
				<description>
					Signals that the caller is done using this object reference, so internal ORB resources associated with this object reference can be released. Note that the object implementation is not involved in this operation, and other references to the same object are not affected.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Object _get_interface_def()
				</name>
				<description>
					Obtains an InterfaceDef for the object implementation referenced by this object reference. The InterfaceDef object may be used to introspect on the methods, attributes, and other type information for the object referred to by this object reference.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Request _request(String operation)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a Request instance for use in the Dynamic Invocation Interface.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Request _create_request(Context ctx,                        String operation,                        NVList arg_list,                        NamedValue result)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a Request instance initialized with the given context, method name, list of arguments, and container for the method's return value.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Request _create_request(Context ctx,                        String operation,                        NVList arg_list,                        NamedValue result,                        ExceptionList exclist,                        ContextList ctxlist)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a Request instance initialized with the given context, method name, list of arguments, container for the method's return value, list of possible exceptions, and list of context strings needing to be resolved.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Policy _get_policy(int policy_type)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the Policy object of the specified type which applies to this object.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					DomainManager[] _get_domain_managers()
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the DomainManagers of this object. This allows administration services (and applications) to retrieve the domain managers, and hence the security and other policies applicable to individual objects that are members of the domain.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					Object _set_policy_override(Policy[] policies,                            SetOverrideType set_add)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a new Object with the given policies either replacing any existing policies in this Object or with the given policies added to the existing ones, depending on the value of the given SetOverrideType object.
