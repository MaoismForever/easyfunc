		</name>
		<description>
			A selectable channel for datagram-oriented sockets. A datagram channel is created by invoking one of the open methods of this class. It is not possible to create a channel for an arbitrary, pre-existing datagram socket. A newly-created datagram channel is open but not connected. A datagram channel need not be connected in order for the send and receive methods to be used. A datagram channel may be connected, by invoking its connect method, in order to avoid the overhead of the security checks are otherwise performed as part of every send and receive operation. A datagram channel must be connected in order to use the read and write methods, since those methods do not accept or return socket addresses. Once connected, a datagram channel remains connected until it is disconnected or closed. Whether or not a datagram channel is connected may be determined by invoking its isConnected method. Socket options are configured using the setOption method. A datagram channel to an Internet Protocol socket supports the following options: Option Name Description SO_SNDBUF The size of the socket send buffer SO_RCVBUF The size of the socket receive buffer SO_REUSEADDR Re-use address SO_BROADCAST Allow transmission of broadcast datagrams IP_TOS The Type of Service (ToS) octet in the Internet Protocol (IP) header IP_MULTICAST_IF The network interface for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast datagrams IP_MULTICAST_TTL The time-to-live for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast datagrams IP_MULTICAST_LOOP Loopback for Internet Protocol (IP) multicast datagrams Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported. Datagram channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads. They support concurrent reading and writing, though at most one thread may be reading and at most one thread may be writing at any given time.

			<method>
				<name>
					protected DatagramChannel(SelectorProvider provider)
				</name>
				<description>
					Initializes a new instance of this class.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static DatagramChannel open()                              throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Opens a datagram channel. The new channel is created by invoking the openDatagramChannel method of the system-wide default SelectorProvider object. The channel will not be connected. The ProtocolFamily of the channel's socket is platform (and possibly configuration) dependent and therefore unspecified. The open allows the protocol family to be selected when opening a datagram channel, and should be used to open datagram channels that are intended for Internet Protocol multicasting.

				<name>
					public static DatagramChannel open(ProtocolFamily family)                              throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Opens a datagram channel. The family parameter is used to specify the ProtocolFamily. If the datagram channel is to be used for IP multicasing then this should correspond to the address type of the multicast groups that this channel will join. The new channel is created by invoking the openDatagramChannel method of the system-wide default SelectorProvider object. The channel will not be connected.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final int validOps()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an operation set identifying this channel's supported operations. Datagram channels support reading and writing, so this method returns (SelectionKey.OP_READ | SelectionKey.OP_WRITE).
				</description>

					public abstract DatagramChannel bind(SocketAddress local)                                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: NetworkChannel Binds the channel's socket to a local address. This method is used to establish an association between the socket and a local address. Once an association is established then the socket remains bound until the channel is closed. If the local parameter has the value null then the socket will be bound to an address that is assigned automatically.

					public abstract DatagramChannel connect(SocketAddress remote)                                   throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Connects this channel's socket. The channel's socket is configured so that it only receives datagrams from, and sends datagrams to, the given remote peer address. Once connected, datagrams may not be received from or sent to any other address. A datagram socket remains connected until it is explicitly disconnected or until it is closed. This method performs exactly the same security checks as the connect method of the DatagramSocket class. That is, if a security manager has been installed then this method verifies that its checkAccept and checkConnect methods permit datagrams to be received from and sent to, respectively, the given remote address. This method may be invoked at any time. It will not have any effect on read or write operations that are already in progress at the moment that it is invoked. If this channel's socket is not bound then this method will first cause the socket to be bound to an address that is assigned automatically, as if invoking the bind method with a parameter of null.

					public abstract DatagramChannel disconnect()                                      throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Disconnects this channel's socket. The channel's socket is configured so that it can receive datagrams from, and sends datagrams to, any remote address so long as the security manager, if installed, permits it. This method may be invoked at any time. It will not have any effect on read or write operations that are already in progress at the moment that it is invoked. If this channel's socket is not connected, or if the channel is closed, then invoking this method has no effect.

					public abstract SocketAddress receive(ByteBuffer dst)                                 throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Receives a datagram via this channel. If a datagram is immediately available, or if this channel is in blocking mode and one eventually becomes available, then the datagram is copied into the given byte buffer and its source address is returned. If this channel is in non-blocking mode and a datagram is not immediately available then this method immediately returns null. The datagram is transferred into the given byte buffer starting at its current position, as if by a regular read operation. If there are fewer bytes remaining in the buffer than are required to hold the datagram then the remainder of the datagram is silently discarded. This method performs exactly the same security checks as the receive method of the DatagramSocket class. That is, if the socket is not connected to a specific remote address and a security manager has been installed then for each datagram received this method verifies that the source's address and port number are permitted by the security manager's checkAccept method. The overhead of this security check can be avoided by first connecting the socket via the connect method. This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has already initiated a read operation upon this channel, however, then an invocation of this method will block until the first operation is complete. If this channel's socket is not bound then this method will first cause the socket to be bound to an address that is assigned automatically, as if invoking the bind method with a parameter of null.

					public abstract int send(ByteBuffer src,         SocketAddress target)                    throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sends a datagram via this channel. If this channel is in non-blocking mode and there is sufficient room in the underlying output buffer, or if this channel is in blocking mode and sufficient room becomes available, then the remaining bytes in the given buffer are transmitted as a single datagram to the given target address. The datagram is transferred from the byte buffer as if by a regular write operation. This method performs exactly the same security checks as the send method of the DatagramSocket class. That is, if the socket is not connected to a specific remote address and a security manager has been installed then for each datagram sent this method verifies that the target address and port number are permitted by the security manager's checkConnect method. The overhead of this security check can be avoided by first connecting the socket via the connect method. This method may be invoked at any time. If another thread has already initiated a write operation upon this channel, however, then an invocation of this method will block until the first operation is complete. If this channel's socket is not bound then this method will first cause the socket to be bound to an address that is assigned automatically, as if by invoking the bind method with a parameter of null.

Otherwise this method behaves exactly as specified in the ReadableByteChannel interface.
