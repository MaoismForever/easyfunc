			The ProcessingInstruction interface represents a "processing instruction", used in XML as a way to keep processor-specific information in the text of the document. No lexical check is done on the content of a processing instruction and it is therefore possible to have the character sequence "?>" in the content, which is illegal a processing instruction per section 2.6 of [XML 1.0]. The presence of this character sequence must generate a fatal error during serialization. See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification.
