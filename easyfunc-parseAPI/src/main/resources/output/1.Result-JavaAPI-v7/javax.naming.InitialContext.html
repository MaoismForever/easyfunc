		</name>
		<description>
			This class is the starting context for performing naming operations. All naming operations are relative to a context. The initial context implements the Context interface and provides the starting point for resolution of names. When the initial context is constructed, its environment is initialized with properties defined in the environment parameter passed to the constructor, and in any application resource files. In addition, a small number of standard JNDI properties may be specified as system properties or as applet parameters (through the use of Context.APPLET). These special properties are listed in the field detail sections of the Context and LdapContext interface documentation. JNDI determines each property's value by merging the values from the following two sources, in order: The first occurrence of the property from the constructor's environment parameter and (for appropriate properties) the applet parameters and system properties. The application resource files (jndi.properties). For each property found in both of these two sources, or in more than one application resource file, the property's value is determined as follows. If the property is one of the standard JNDI properties that specify a list of JNDI factories (see Context), all of the values are concatenated into a single colon-separated list. For other properties, only the first value found is used. The initial context implementation is determined at runtime. The default policy uses the environment property "java.naming.factory.initial", which contains the class name of the initial context factory. An exception to this policy is made when resolving URL strings, as described below. When a URL string (a String of the form scheme_id:rest_of_name) is passed as a name parameter to any method, a URL context factory for handling that scheme is located and used to resolve the URL. If no such factory is found, the initial context specified by "java.naming.factory.initial" is used. Similarly, when a CompositeName object whose first component is a URL string is passed as a name parameter to any method, a URL context factory is located and used to resolve the first name component. See NamingManager.getURLContext() for a description of how URL context factories are located. This default policy of locating the initial context and URL context factories may be overridden by calling NamingManager.setInitialContextFactoryBuilder(). NoInitialContextException is thrown when an initial context cannot be instantiated. This exception can be thrown during any interaction with the InitialContext, not only when the InitialContext is constructed. For example, the implementation of the initial context might lazily retrieve the context only when actual methods are invoked on it. The application should not have any dependency on when the existence of an initial context is determined. When the environment property "java.naming.factory.initial" is non-null, the InitialContext constructor will attempt to create the initial context specified therein. At that time, the initial context factory involved might throw an exception if a problem is encountered. However, it is provider implementation-dependent when it verifies and indicates to the users of the initial context any environment property- or connection- related problems. It can do so lazily--delaying until an operation is performed on the context, or eagerly, at the time the context is constructed. An InitialContext instance is not synchronized against concurrent access by multiple threads. Multiple threads each manipulating a different InitialContext instance need not synchronize. Threads that need to access a single InitialContext instance concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking.

				<description>
					Constructs an initial context with the option of not initializing it. This may be used by a constructor in a subclass when the value of the environment parameter is not yet known at the time the InitialContext constructor is called. The subclass's constructor will call this constructor, compute the value of the environment, and then call init() before returning.

				<description>
					Constructs an initial context using the supplied environment. Environment properties are discussed in the class description. This constructor will not modify environment or save a reference to it, but may save a clone. Caller should not modify mutable keys and values in environment after it has been passed to the constructor.

				<description>
					Retrieves a context for resolving the string name name. If name name is a URL string, then attempt to find a URL context for it. If none is found, or if name is not a URL string, then return getDefaultInitCtx(). See getURLOrDefaultInitCtx(Name) for description of how a subclass should use this method.

				<description>
					Retrieves a context for resolving name. If the first component of name name is a URL string, then attempt to find a URL context for it. If none is found, or if the first component of name is not a URL string, then return getDefaultInitCtx(). When creating a subclass of InitialContext, use this method as follows. Define a new method that uses this method to get an initial context of the desired subclass.    protected XXXContext getURLOrDefaultInitXXXCtx(Name name)   throws NamingException {    Context answer = getURLOrDefaultInitCtx(name);    if (!(answer instanceof XXXContext)) {      if (answer == null) {        throw new NoInitialContextException();      } else {        throw new NotContextException("Not an XXXContext");      }    }    return (XXXContext)answer;   }   When providing implementations for the new methods in the subclass, use this newly defined method to get the initial context.    public Object XXXMethod1(Name name, ...) {    throws NamingException {      return getURLOrDefaultInitXXXCtx(name).XXXMethod1(name, ...);   }

				<name>
					public void destroySubcontext(Name name)                         throws NamingException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: Context Destroys the named context and removes it from the namespace. Any attributes associated with the name are also removed. Intermediate contexts are not destroyed. This method is idempotent. It succeeds even if the terminal atomic name is not bound in the target context, but throws NameNotFoundException if any of the intermediate contexts do not exist. In a federated naming system, a context from one naming system may be bound to a name in another. One can subsequently look up and perform operations on the foreign context using a composite name. However, an attempt destroy the context using this composite name will fail with NotContextException, because the foreign context is not a "subcontext" of the context in which it is bound. Instead, use unbind() to remove the binding of the foreign context. Destroying the foreign context requires that the destroySubcontext() be performed on a context from the foreign context's "native" naming system.

This method allows an application to get a parser for parsing names into their atomic components using the naming convention of a particular naming system. Within any single naming system, NameParser objects returned by this method must be equal (using the equals() test).

				<description>
					Description copied from interface: Context Closes this context. This method releases this context's resources immediately, instead of waiting for them to be released automatically by the garbage collector. This method is idempotent: invoking it on a context that has already been closed has no effect. Invoking any other method on a closed context is not allowed, and results in undefined behaviour.

					public String getNameInNamespace()                            throws NamingException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: Context Retrieves the full name of this context within its own namespace. Many naming services have a notion of a "full name" for objects in their respective namespaces. For example, an LDAP entry has a distinguished name, and a DNS record has a fully qualified name. This method allows the client application to retrieve this name. The string returned by this method is not a JNDI composite name and should not be passed directly to context methods. In naming systems for which the notion of full name does not make sense, OperationNotSupportedException is thrown.
