		<description>
			An "IndexedPropertyChange" event gets delivered whenever a component that conforms to the JavaBeans™ specification (a "bean") changes a bound indexed property. This class is an extension of PropertyChangeEvent but contains the index of the property that has changed. Null values may be provided for the old and the new values if their true values are not known. An event source may send a null object as the name to indicate that an arbitrary set of if its properties have changed. In this case the old and new values should also be null.
