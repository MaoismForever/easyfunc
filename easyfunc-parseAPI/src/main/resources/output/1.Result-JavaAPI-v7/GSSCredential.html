			public interface GSSCredential  extends Cloneable
		</name>
		<description>
			This interface encapsulates the GSS-API credentials for an entity. A credential contains all the necessary cryptographic information to enable the creation of a context on behalf of the entity that it represents. It may contain multiple, distinct, mechanism specific credential elements, each containing information for a specific security mechanism, but all referring to the same entity. A credential may be used to perform context initiation, acceptance, or both. Credentials are instantiated using one of the createCredential methods in the GSSManager class. GSS-API credential creation is not intended to provide a "login to the network" function, as such a function would involve the creation of new credentials rather than merely acquiring a handle to existing credentials. The section on credential acquisition in the package level description describes how existing credentials are acquired in the Java platform. GSS-API implementations must impose a local access-control policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to which they are not entitled. Applications will create a credential object passing the desired parameters. The application can then use the query methods to obtain specific information about the instantiated credential object. When the credential is no longer needed, the application should call the dispose method to release any resources held by the credential object and to destroy any cryptographically sensitive information. This example code demonstrates the creation of a GSSCredential implementation for a specific entity, querying of its fields, and its release when it is no longer needed:       GSSManager manager = GSSManager.getInstance();        // start by creating a name object for the entity      GSSName name = manager.createName("myusername", GSSName.NT_USER_NAME);        // now acquire credentials for the entity      GSSCredential cred = manager.createCredential(name,                      GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY);        // display credential information - name, remaining lifetime,      // and the mechanisms it has been acquired over      System.out.println(cred.getName().toString());      System.out.println(cred.getRemainingLifetime());        Oid [] mechs = cred.getMechs();      if (mechs != null) {              for (int i = 0; i < mechs.length; i++)                      System.out.println(mechs[i].toString());      }        // release system resources held by the credential      cred.dispose();

					Returns the credential usage mode. In other words, it tells us if this credential can be used for initiating or accepting security contexts. It does not tell us which mechanism(s) has to be used in order to do so. It is expected that an application will allow the GSS-API to pick a default mechanism after calling this method.

				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a mechanism specific credential-element to an existing credential. This method allows the construction of credentials, one mechanism at a time. This routine is envisioned to be used mainly by context acceptors during the creation of acceptor credentials which are to be used with a variety of clients using different security mechanisms. This routine adds the new credential element "in-place". To add the element in a new credential, first call clone to obtain a copy of this credential, then call its add method. As always, GSS-API implementations must impose a local access-control policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to which they are not entitled. Non-default values for initLifetime and acceptLifetime cannot always be honored by the underlying mechanisms, thus callers should be prepared to call getRemainingInitLifetime and getRemainingAcceptLifetime on the credential.
