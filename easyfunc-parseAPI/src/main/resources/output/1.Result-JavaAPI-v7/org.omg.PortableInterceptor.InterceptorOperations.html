			All Portable Interceptors implement Interceptor.

			<method>
				<name>
					String name()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the name of the interceptor. Each Interceptor may have a name that may be used administratively to order the lists of Interceptors. Only one Interceptor of a given name can be registered with the ORB for each Interceptor type. An Interceptor may be anonymous, i.e., have an empty string as the name attribute. Any number of anonymous Interceptors may be registered with the ORB.

			<method>
				<name>
					void destroy()
				</name>
				<description>
					Provides an opportunity to destroy this interceptor. The destroy method is called during ORB.destroy. When an application calls ORB.destroy, the ORB: waits for all requests in progress to complete calls the Interceptor.destroy operation for each interceptor completes destruction of the ORB Method invocations from within Interceptor.destroy on object references for objects implemented on the ORB being destroyed result in undefined behavior. However, method invocations on objects implemented on an ORB other than the one being destroyed are permitted. (This means that the ORB being destroyed is still capable of acting as a client, but not as a server.)
