			public class RandomAccessFile  extends Object  implements DataOutput, DataInput, Closeable
		</name>
		<description>
			Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a random access file. A random access file behaves like a large array of bytes stored in the file system. There is a kind of cursor, or index into the implied array, called the file pointer; input operations read bytes starting at the file pointer and advance the file pointer past the bytes read. If the random access file is created in read/write mode, then output operations are also available; output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be extended. The file pointer can be read by the getFilePointer method and set by the seek method. It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been read, an EOFException (which is a kind of IOException) is thrown. If any byte cannot be read for any reason other than end-of-file, an IOException other than EOFException is thrown. In particular, an IOException may be thrown if the stream has been closed.

					public RandomAccessFile(String name,                  String mode)                   throws FileNotFoundException
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally to write to, a file with the specified name. A new FileDescriptor object is created to represent the connection to the file. The mode argument specifies the access mode with which the file is to be opened. The permitted values and their meanings are as specified for the RandomAccessFile(File,String) constructor. If there is a security manager, its checkRead method is called with the name argument as its argument to see if read access to the file is allowed. If the mode allows writing, the security manager's checkWrite method is also called with the name argument as its argument to see if write access to the file is allowed.

				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a random access file stream to read from, and optionally to write to, the file specified by the File argument. A new FileDescriptor object is created to represent this file connection. The mode argument specifies the access mode in which the file is to be opened. The permitted values and their meanings are: Value Meaning "r" Open for reading only. Invoking any of the write methods of the resulting object will cause an IOException to be thrown. "rw" Open for reading and writing. If the file does not already exist then an attempt will be made to create it. "rws" Open for reading and writing, as with "rw", and also require that every update to the file's content or metadata be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. "rwd"   Open for reading and writing, as with "rw", and also require that every update to the file's content be written synchronously to the underlying storage device. The "rws" and "rwd" modes work much like the force(boolean) method of the FileChannel class, passing arguments of true and false, respectively, except that they always apply to every I/O operation and are therefore often more efficient. If the file resides on a local storage device then when an invocation of a method of this class returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file by that invocation will have been written to that device. This is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash. If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee is made. The "rwd" mode can be used to reduce the number of I/O operations performed. Using "rwd" only requires updates to the file's content to be written to storage; using "rws" requires updates to both the file's content and its metadata to be written, which generally requires at least one more low-level I/O operation. If there is a security manager, its checkRead method is called with the pathname of the file argument as its argument to see if read access to the file is allowed. If the mode allows writing, the security manager's checkWrite method is also called with the path argument to see if write access to the file is allowed.

				<description>
					Returns the opaque file descriptor object associated with this stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final FileChannel getChannel()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the unique FileChannel object associated with this file. The position of the returned channel will always be equal to this object's file-pointer offset as returned by the getFilePointer method. Changing this object's file-pointer offset, whether explicitly or by reading or writing bytes, will change the position of the channel, and vice versa. Changing the file's length via this object will change the length seen via the file channel, and vice versa.

				<name>
					public int skipBytes(int n)                throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Attempts to skip over n bytes of input discarding the skipped bytes. This method may skip over some smaller number of bytes, possibly zero. This may result from any of a number of conditions; reaching end of file before n bytes have been skipped is only one possibility. This method never throws an EOFException. The actual number of bytes skipped is returned. If n is negative, no bytes are skipped.

					public void seek(long pos)            throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the file-pointer offset, measured from the beginning of this file, at which the next read or write occurs. The offset may be set beyond the end of the file. Setting the offset beyond the end of the file does not change the file length. The file length will change only by writing after the offset has been set beyond the end of the file.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the length of this file. If the present length of the file as returned by the length method is greater than the newLength argument then the file will be truncated. In this case, if the file offset as returned by the getFilePointer method is greater than newLength then after this method returns the offset will be equal to newLength. If the present length of the file as returned by the length method is smaller than the newLength argument then the file will be extended. In this case, the contents of the extended portion of the file are not defined.

					public final float readFloat()                        throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads a float from this file. This method reads an int value, starting at the current file pointer, as if by the readInt method and then converts that int to a float using the intBitsToFloat method in class Float. This method blocks until the four bytes are read, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.

					public final double readDouble()                          throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads a double from this file. This method reads a long value, starting at the current file pointer, as if by the readLong method and then converts that long to a double using the longBitsToDouble method in class Double.

				<name>
					public final String readLine()                        throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads the next line of text from this file. This method successively reads bytes from the file, starting at the current file pointer, until it reaches a line terminator or the end of the file. Each byte is converted into a character by taking the byte's value for the lower eight bits of the character and setting the high eight bits of the character to zero. This method does not, therefore, support the full Unicode character set. A line of text is terminated by a carriage-return character ('\r'), a newline character ('\n'), a carriage-return character immediately followed by a newline character, or the end of the file. Line-terminating characters are discarded and are not included as part of the string returned. This method blocks until a newline character is read, a carriage return and the byte following it are read (to see if it is a newline), the end of the file is reached, or an exception is thrown.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final String readUTF()                       throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Reads in a string from this file. The string has been encoded using a modified UTF-8 format. The first two bytes are read, starting from the current file pointer, as if by readUnsignedShort. This value gives the number of following bytes that are in the encoded string, not the length of the resulting string. The following bytes are then interpreted as bytes encoding characters in the modified UTF-8 format and are converted into characters. This method blocks until all the bytes are read, the end of the stream is detected, or an exception is thrown.
