		<description>
			One of the primary functions of a BeanContext is to act a as rendezvous between JavaBeans, and BeanContextServiceProviders. A JavaBean nested within a BeanContext, may ask that BeanContext to provide an instance of a "service", based upon a reference to a Java Class object that represents that service. If such a service has been registered with the context, or one of its nesting context's, in the case where a context delegate to its context to satisfy a service request, then the BeanContextServiceProvider associated with the service is asked to provide an instance of that service. The ServcieProvider may always return the same instance, or it may construct a new instance for each request.

					Invoked by BeanContextServices, this method releases a nested BeanContextChild's (or any arbitrary object associated with a BeanContextChild) reference to the specified service.

				<description>
					Invoked by BeanContextServices, this method gets the current service selectors for the specified service. A service selector is a service specific parameter, typical examples of which could include: a parameter to a constructor for the service implementation class, a value for a particular service's property, or a key into a map of existing implementations.
