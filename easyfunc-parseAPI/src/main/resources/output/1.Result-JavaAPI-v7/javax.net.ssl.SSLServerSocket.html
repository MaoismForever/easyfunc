			public abstract class SSLServerSocket  extends ServerSocket
		</name>
		<description>
			This class extends ServerSockets and provides secure server sockets using protocols such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols. Instances of this class are generally created using a SSLServerSocketFactory. The primary function of SSLServerSockets is to create SSLSockets by accepting connections. SSLServerSockets contain several pieces of state data which are inherited by the SSLSocket at socket creation. These include the enabled cipher suites and protocols, whether client authentication is necessary, and whether created sockets should begin handshaking in client or server mode. The state inherited by the created SSLSocket can be overriden by calling the appropriate methods.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected SSLServerSocket()                     throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Used only by subclasses. Create an unbound TCP server socket using the default authentication context.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected SSLServerSocket(int port)                     throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Used only by subclasses. Create a TCP server socket on a port, using the default authentication context. The connection backlog defaults to fifty connections queued up before the system starts to reject new connection requests. A port number of 0 creates a socket on any free port. If there is a security manager, its checkListen method is called with the port argument as its argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result in a SecurityException.

				<name>
					protected SSLServerSocket(int port,                 int backlog)                     throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Used only by subclasses. Create a TCP server socket on a port, using the default authentication context and a specified backlog of connections. A port number of 0 creates a socket on any free port. The backlog argument is the requested maximum number of pending connections on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation specific. In particular, an implementation may impose a maximum length or may choose to ignore the parameter altogther. The value provided should be greater than 0. If it is less than or equal to 0, then an implementation specific default will be used. If there is a security manager, its checkListen method is called with the port argument as its argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result in a SecurityException.

				</name>
				<description>
					Used only by subclasses. Create a TCP server socket on a port, using the default authentication context and a specified backlog of connections as well as a particular specified network interface. This constructor is used on multihomed hosts, such as those used for firewalls or as routers, to control through which interface a network service is provided. If there is a security manager, its checkListen method is called with the port argument as its argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result in a SecurityException. A port number of 0 creates a socket on any free port. The backlog argument is the requested maximum number of pending connections on the socket. Its exact semantics are implementation specific. In particular, an implementation may impose a maximum length or may choose to ignore the parameter altogther. The value provided should be greater than 0. If it is less than or equal to 0, then an implementation specific default will be used. If address is null, it will default accepting connections on any/all local addresses.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract String[] getEnabledCipherSuites()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the list of cipher suites which are currently enabled for use by newly accepted connections. If this list has not been explicitly modified, a system-provided default guarantees a minimum quality of service in all enabled cipher suites. There are several reasons why an enabled cipher suite might not actually be used. For example: the server socket might not have appropriate private keys available to it or the cipher suite might be anonymous, precluding the use of client authentication, while the server socket has been told to require that sort of authentication.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void setEnabledCipherSuites(String[] suites)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the cipher suites enabled for use by accepted connections. The cipher suites must have been listed by getSupportedCipherSuites() as being supported. Following a successful call to this method, only suites listed in the suites parameter are enabled for use. Suites that require authentication information which is not available in this ServerSocket's authentication context will not be used in any case, even if they are enabled. SSLSockets returned from accept() inherit this setting.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract String[] getSupportedCipherSuites()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the names of the cipher suites which could be enabled for use on an SSL connection. Normally, only a subset of these will actually be enabled by default, since this list may include cipher suites which do not meet quality of service requirements for those defaults. Such cipher suites are useful in specialized applications.

			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract String[] getSupportedProtocols()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the names of the protocols which could be enabled for use.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract String[] getEnabledProtocols()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the names of the protocols which are currently enabled for use by the newly accepted connections.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void setEnabledProtocols(String[] protocols)
				</name>
				<description>
					Controls which particular protocols are enabled for use by accepted connections. The protocols must have been listed by getSupportedProtocols() as being supported. Following a successful call to this method, only protocols listed in the protocols parameter are enabled for use. SSLSockets returned from accept() inherit this setting.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void setNeedClientAuth(boolean need)
				</name>
				<description>
					Controls whether accepted server-mode SSLSockets will be initially configured to require client authentication. A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following: client authentication required client authentication requested no client authentication desired Unlike setWantClientAuth(boolean), if the accepted socket's option is set and the client chooses not to provide authentication information about itself, the negotiations will stop and the connection will be dropped. Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by this method or setWantClientAuth(boolean). The initial inherited setting may be overridden by calling SSLSocket.setNeedClientAuth(boolean) or SSLSocket.setWantClientAuth(boolean).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract boolean getNeedClientAuth()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if client authentication will be required on newly accepted server-mode SSLSockets. The initial inherited setting may be overridden by calling SSLSocket.setNeedClientAuth(boolean) or SSLSocket.setWantClientAuth(boolean).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void setWantClientAuth(boolean want)
				</name>
				<description>
					Controls whether accepted server-mode SSLSockets will be initially configured to request client authentication. A socket's client authentication setting is one of the following: client authentication required client authentication requested no client authentication desired Unlike setNeedClientAuth(boolean), if the accepted socket's option is set and the client chooses not to provide authentication information about itself, the negotiations will continue. Calling this method overrides any previous setting made by this method or setNeedClientAuth(boolean). The initial inherited setting may be overridden by calling SSLSocket.setNeedClientAuth(boolean) or SSLSocket.setWantClientAuth(boolean).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract boolean getWantClientAuth()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if client authentication will be requested on newly accepted server-mode connections. The initial inherited setting may be overridden by calling SSLSocket.setNeedClientAuth(boolean) or SSLSocket.setWantClientAuth(boolean).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void setUseClientMode(boolean mode)
				</name>
				<description>
					Controls whether accepted connections are in the (default) SSL server mode, or the SSL client mode. Servers normally authenticate themselves, and clients are not required to do so. In rare cases, TCP servers need to act in the SSL client mode on newly accepted connections. For example, FTP clients acquire server sockets and listen there for reverse connections from the server. An FTP client would use an SSLServerSocket in "client" mode to accept the reverse connection while the FTP server uses an SSLSocket with "client" mode disabled to initiate the connection. During the resulting handshake, existing SSL sessions may be reused. SSLSockets returned from accept() inherit this setting.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract boolean getUseClientMode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if accepted connections will be in SSL client mode.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract void setEnableSessionCreation(boolean flag)
				</name>
				<description>
					Controls whether new SSL sessions may be established by the sockets which are created from this server socket. SSLSockets returned from accept() inherit this setting.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public abstract boolean getEnableSessionCreation()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if new SSL sessions may be established by the sockets which are created from this server socket.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public SSLParameters getSSLParameters()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the SSLParameters in effect for newly accepted connections. The ciphersuites and protocols of the returned SSLParameters are always non-null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setSSLParameters(SSLParameters params)
				</name>
				<description>
					Applies SSLParameters to newly accepted connections. This means: if params.getCipherSuites() is non-null, setEnabledCipherSuites() is called with that value if params.getProtocols() is non-null, setEnabledProtocols() is called with that value if params.getNeedClientAuth() or params.getWantClientAuth() return true, setNeedClientAuth(true) and setWantClientAuth(true) are called, respectively; otherwise setWantClientAuth(false) is called.
