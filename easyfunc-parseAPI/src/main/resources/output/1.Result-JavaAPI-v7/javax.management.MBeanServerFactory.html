			public class MBeanServerFactory  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			Provides MBean server references. There are no instances of this class. Since JMX 1.2 this class makes it possible to replace the default MBeanServer implementation. This is done using the MBeanServerBuilder class. The class of the initial MBeanServerBuilder to be instantiated can be specified through the javax.management.builder.initial system property. The specified class must be a public subclass of MBeanServerBuilder, and must have a public empty constructor. By default, if no value for that property is specified, an instance of javax.management.MBeanServerBuilder is created. Otherwise, the MBeanServerFactory attempts to load the specified class using Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader(), or if that is null, Class.forName(). Then it creates an initial instance of that Class using Class.newInstance(). If any checked exception is raised during this process (e.g. ClassNotFoundException, InstantiationException) the MBeanServerFactory will propagate this exception from within a RuntimeException. The javax.management.builder.initial system property is consulted every time a new MBeanServer needs to be created, and the class pointed to by that property is loaded. If that class is different from that of the current MBeanServerBuilder, then a new MBeanServerBuilder is created. Otherwise, the MBeanServerFactory may create a new MBeanServerBuilder or reuse the current one. If the class pointed to by the property cannot be loaded, or does not correspond to a valid subclass of MBeanServerBuilder then an exception is propagated, and no MBeanServer can be created until the javax.management.builder.initial system property is reset to valid value. The MBeanServerBuilder makes it possible to wrap the MBeanServers returned by the default MBeanServerBuilder implementation, for the purpose of e.g. adding an additional security layer.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static void releaseMBeanServer(MBeanServer mbeanServer)
				</name>
				<description>
					Remove internal MBeanServerFactory references to a created MBeanServer. This allows the garbage collector to remove the MBeanServer object.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static MBeanServer createMBeanServer()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return a new object implementing the MBeanServer interface with a standard default domain name. The default domain name is used as the domain part in the ObjectName of MBeans when the domain is specified by the user is null. The standard default domain name is DefaultDomain. The MBeanServer reference is internally kept. This will allow findMBeanServer to return a reference to this MBeanServer object. This method is equivalent to createMBeanServer(null).

			<method>
				<name>
					public static MBeanServer createMBeanServer(String domain)
				</name>
				<description>
					Return a new object implementing the MBeanServer interface with the specified default domain name. The given domain name is used as the domain part in the ObjectName of MBeans when the domain is specified by the user is null. The MBeanServer reference is internally kept. This will allow findMBeanServer to return a reference to this MBeanServer object.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static MBeanServer newMBeanServer()
				</name>
				<description>
					Return a new object implementing the MBeanServer interface with a standard default domain name, without keeping an internal reference to this new object. The default domain name is used as the domain part in the ObjectName of MBeans when the domain is specified by the user is null. The standard default domain name is DefaultDomain. No reference is kept. findMBeanServer will not be able to return a reference to this MBeanServer object, but the garbage collector will be able to remove the MBeanServer object when it is no longer referenced. This method is equivalent to newMBeanServer(null).

			<method>
				<name>
					public static ArrayList<MBeanServer> findMBeanServer(String agentId)
				</name>
				<description>
					Return a list of registered MBeanServer objects. A registered MBeanServer object is one that was created by one of the createMBeanServer methods and not subsequently released with releaseMBeanServer.

				<description>
					Return the ClassLoaderRepository used by the given MBeanServer. This method is equivalent to server.getClassLoaderRepository().
