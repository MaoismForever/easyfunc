		<description>
			The listener interface for receiving "interesting" mouse events (press, release, click, enter, and exit) on a component. (To track mouse moves and mouse drags, use the MouseMotionListener.) The class that is interested in processing a mouse event either implements this interface (and all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract MouseAdapter class (overriding only the methods of interest). The listener object created from that class is then registered with a component using the component's addMouseListener method. A mouse event is generated when the mouse is pressed, released clicked (pressed and released). A mouse event is also generated when the mouse cursor enters or leaves a component. When a mouse event occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and the MouseEvent is passed to it.
