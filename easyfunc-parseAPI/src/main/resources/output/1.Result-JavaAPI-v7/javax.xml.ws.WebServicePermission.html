		<description>
			This class defines web service permissions. Web service Permissions are identified by name (also referred to as a "target name") alone. There are no actions associated with them. The following permission target name is defined: publishEndpoint The publishEndpoint permission allows publishing a web service endpoint using the publish methods defined by the javax.xml.ws.Endpoint class. Granting publishEndpoint allows the application to be exposed as a network service. Depending on the security of the runtime and the security of the application, this may introduce a security hole that is remotely exploitable.
