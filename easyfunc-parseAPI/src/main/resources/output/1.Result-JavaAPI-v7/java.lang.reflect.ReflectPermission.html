			The Permission class for reflective operations. A ReflectPermission is a named permission and has no actions. The only name currently defined is suppressAccessChecks, which allows suppressing the standard Java language access checks -- for public, default (package) access, protected, and private members -- performed by reflected objects at their point of use. The following table provides a summary description of what the permission allows, and discusses the risks of granting code the permission. Permission Target Name What the Permission Allows Risks of Allowing this Permission suppressAccessChecks ability to access fields and invoke methods in a class. Note that this includes not only public, but protected and private fields and methods as well. This is dangerous in that information (possibly confidential) and methods normally unavailable would be accessible to malicious code.
