		<description>
			The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. The usual push and pop operations are provided, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to test for whether the stack is empty, and a method to search the stack for an item and discover how far it is from the top. When a stack is first created, it contains no items. A more complete and consistent set of LIFO stack operations is provided by the Deque interface and its implementations, which should be used in preference to this class. For example:    Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<Integer>();

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Stack()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates an empty Stack.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public E push(E item)
				</name>
				<description>
					Pushes an item onto the top of this stack. This has exactly the same effect as:    addElement(item)
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public E pop()
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes the object at the top of this stack and returns that object as the value of this function.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public E peek()
				</name>
				<description>
					Looks at the object at the top of this stack without removing it from the stack.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean empty()
				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if this stack is empty.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int search(Object o)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the 1-based position where an object is on this stack. If the object o occurs as an item in this stack, this method returns the distance from the top of the stack of the occurrence nearest the top of the stack; the topmost item on the stack is considered to be at distance 1. The equals method is used to compare o to the items in this stack.
