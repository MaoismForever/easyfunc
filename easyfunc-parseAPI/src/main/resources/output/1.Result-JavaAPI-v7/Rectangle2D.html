			public abstract class Rectangle2D  extends RectangularShape
		</name>
		<description>
			The Rectangle2D class describes a rectangle defined by a location (x,y) and dimension (w x h). This class is only the abstract superclass for all objects that store a 2D rectangle. The actual storage representation of the coordinates is left to the subclass.

			<method>
				<name>
					public Rectangle2D getBounds2D()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a high precision and more accurate bounding box of the Shape than the getBounds method. Note that there is no guarantee that the returned Rectangle2D is the smallest bounding box that encloses the Shape, only that the Shape lies entirely within the indicated Rectangle2D. The bounding box returned by this method is usually tighter than that returned by the getBounds method and never fails due to overflow problems since the return value can be an instance of the Rectangle2D that uses double precision values to store the dimensions. Note that the definition of insideness can lead to situations where points on the defining outline of the shape may not be considered contained in the returned bounds object, but only in cases where those points are also not considered contained in the original shape. If a point is inside the shape according to the contains(point) method, then it must be inside the returned Rectangle2D bounds object according to the contains(point) method of the bounds. Specifically: shape.contains(p) requires bounds.contains(p) If a point is not inside the shape, then it might still be contained in the bounds object: bounds.contains(p) does not imply shape.contains(p)

					public boolean contains(double x,                 double y)

					public boolean intersects(double x,                   double y,                   double w,                   double h)
				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the interior of the Shape intersects the interior of a specified rectangular area. The rectangular area is considered to intersect the Shape if any point is contained in both the interior of the Shape and the specified rectangular area. The Shape.intersects() method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return true when: there is a high probability that the rectangular area and the Shape intersect, but the calculations to accurately determine this intersection are prohibitively expensive. This means that for some Shapes this method might return true even though the rectangular area does not intersect the Shape. The Area class performs more accurate computations of geometric intersection than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required.

				</name>
				<description>
					Tests if the interior of the Shape entirely contains the specified rectangular area. All coordinates that lie inside the rectangular area must lie within the Shape for the entire rectanglar area to be considered contained within the Shape. The Shape.contains() method allows a Shape implementation to conservatively return false when: the intersect method returns true and the calculations to determine whether or not the Shape entirely contains the rectangular area are prohibitively expensive. This means that for some Shapes this method might return false even though the Shape contains the rectangular area. The Area class performs more accurate geometric computations than most Shape objects and therefore can be used if a more precise answer is required.

				</name>
				<description>
					Intersects the pair of specified source Rectangle2D objects and puts the result into the specified destination Rectangle2D object. One of the source rectangles can also be the destination to avoid creating a third Rectangle2D object, but in this case the original points of this source rectangle will be overwritten by this method.

				<description>
					Unions the pair of source Rectangle2D objects and puts the result into the specified destination Rectangle2D object.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void add(double newx,         double newy)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a point, specified by the double precision arguments newx and newy, to this Rectangle2D. The resulting Rectangle2D is the smallest Rectangle2D that contains both the original Rectangle2D and the specified point. After adding a point, a call to contains with the added point as an argument does not necessarily return true. The contains method does not return true for points on the right or bottom edges of a rectangle. Therefore, if the added point falls on the left or bottom edge of the enlarged rectangle, contains returns false for that point.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public void add(Point2D pt)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds the Point2D object pt to this Rectangle2D. The resulting Rectangle2D is the smallest Rectangle2D that contains both the original Rectangle2D and the specified Point2D. After adding a point, a call to contains with the added point as an argument does not necessarily return true. The contains method does not return true for points on the right or bottom edges of a rectangle. Therefore, if the added point falls on the left or bottom edge of the enlarged rectangle, contains returns false for that point.

					public PathIterator getPathIterator(AffineTransform at)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an iteration object that defines the boundary of this Rectangle2D. The iterator for this class is multi-threaded safe, which means that this Rectangle2D class guarantees that modifications to the geometry of this Rectangle2D object do not affect any iterations of that geometry that are already in process.

					public PathIterator getPathIterator(AffineTransform at,                             double flatness)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an iteration object that defines the boundary of the flattened Rectangle2D. Since rectangles are already flat, the flatness parameter is ignored. The iterator for this class is multi-threaded safe, which means that this Rectangle2D class guarantees that modifications to the geometry of this Rectangle2D object do not affect any iterations of that geometry that are already in process.
