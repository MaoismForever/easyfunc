		<description>
			A document that models HTML. The purpose of this model is to support both browsing and editing. As a result, the structure described by an HTML document is not exactly replicated by default. The element structure that is modeled by default, is built by the class HTMLDocument.HTMLReader, which implements the HTMLEditorKit.ParserCallback protocol that the parser expects. To change the structure one can subclass HTMLReader, and reimplement the method getReader(int) to return the new reader implementation. The documentation for HTMLReader should be consulted for the details of the default structure created. The intent is that the document be non-lossy (although reproducing the HTML format may result in a different format). The document models only HTML, and makes no attempt to store view attributes in it. The elements are identified by the StyleContext.NameAttribute attribute, which should always have a value of type HTML.Tag that identifies the kind of element. Some of the elements (such as comments) are synthesized. The HTMLFactory uses this attribute to determine what kind of view to build. This document supports incremental loading. The TokenThreshold property controls how much of the parse is buffered before trying to update the element structure of the document. This property is set by the EditorKit so that subclasses can disable it. The Base property determines the URL against which relative URLs are resolved. By default, this will be the Document.StreamDescriptionProperty if the value of the property is a URL. If a <BASE> tag is encountered, the base will become the URL specified by that tag. Because the base URL is a property, it can of course be set directly. The default content storage mechanism for this document is a gap buffer (GapContent). Alternatives can be supplied by using the constructor that takes a Content implementation. Modifying HTMLDocument In addition to the methods provided by Document and StyledDocument for mutating an HTMLDocument, HTMLDocument provides a number of convenience methods. The following methods can be used to insert HTML content into an existing document. setInnerHTML(Element, String) setOuterHTML(Element, String) insertBeforeStart(Element, String) insertAfterStart(Element, String) insertBeforeEnd(Element, String) insertAfterEnd(Element, String) The following examples illustrate using these methods. Each example assumes the HTML document is initialized in the following way:    JEditorPane p = new JEditorPane();   p.setContentType("text/html");   p.setText("..."); // Document text is provided below.   HTMLDocument d = (HTMLDocument) p.getDocument();   With the following HTML content:    <html>     <head>       <title>An example HTMLDocument</title>       <style type="text/css">         div { background-color: silver; }         ul { color: red; }       </style>     </head>     <body>       <div id="BOX">         <p>Paragraph 1</p>         <p>Paragraph 2</p>       </div>     </body>   </html>   All the methods for modifying an HTML document require an Element. Elements can be obtained from an HTML document by using the method getElement(Element e, Object attribute, Object value). It returns the first descendant element that contains the specified attribute with the given value, in depth-first order. For example, d.getElement(d.getDefaultRootElement(), StyleConstants.NameAttribute, HTML.Tag.P) returns the first paragraph element. A convenient shortcut for locating elements is the method getElement(String); returns an element whose ID attribute matches the specified value. For example, d.getElement("BOX") returns the DIV element. The getIterator(HTML.Tag t) method can also be used for finding all occurrences of the specified HTML tag in the document. Inserting elements Elements can be inserted before or after the existing children of any non-leaf element by using the methods insertAfterStart and insertBeforeEnd. For example, if e is the DIV element, d.insertAfterStart(e, "<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>") inserts the list before the first paragraph, and d.insertBeforeEnd(e, "<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>") inserts the list after the last paragraph. The DIV block becomes the parent of the newly inserted elements. Sibling elements can be inserted before or after any element by using the methods insertBeforeStart and insertAfterEnd. For example, if e is the DIV element, d.insertBeforeStart(e, "<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>") inserts the list before the DIV element, and d.insertAfterEnd(e, "<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>") inserts the list after the DIV element. The newly inserted elements become siblings of the DIV element. Replacing elements Elements and all their descendants can be replaced by using the methods setInnerHTML and setOuterHTML. For example, if e is the DIV element, d.setInnerHTML(e, "<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>") replaces all children paragraphs with the list, and d.setOuterHTML(e, "<ul><li>List Item</li></ul>") replaces the DIV element itself. In latter case the parent of the list is the BODY element. Summary The following table shows the example document and the results of various methods described above. Example insertAfterStart insertBeforeEnd insertBeforeStart insertAfterEnd setInnerHTML setOuterHTML Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 List Item Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 List Item List Item Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 Paragraph 1 Paragraph 2 List Item List Item List Item Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void processHTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent(HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent e)
				</name>
				<description>
					Processes HyperlinkEvents that are generated by documents in an HTML frame. The HyperlinkEvent type, as the parameter suggests, is HTMLFrameHyperlinkEvent. In addition to the typical information contained in a HyperlinkEvent, this event contains the element that corresponds to the frame in which the click happened (the source element) and the target name. The target name has 4 possible values: _self _parent _top a named frame If target is _self, the action is to change the value of the HTML.Attribute.SRC attribute and fires a ChangedUpdate event. If the target is _parent, then it deletes the parent element, which is a <FRAMESET> element, and inserts a new <FRAME> element, and sets its HTML.Attribute.SRC attribute to have a value equal to the destination URL and fire a RemovedUpdate and InsertUpdate. If the target is _top, this method does nothing. In the implementation of the view for a frame, namely the FrameView, the processing of _top is handled. Given that _top implies replacing the entire document, it made sense to handle this outside of the document that it will replace. If the target is a named frame, then the element hierarchy is searched for an element with a name equal to the target, its HTML.Attribute.SRC attribute is updated and a ChangedUpdate event is fired.

				</name>
				<description>
					Replaces the children of the given element with the contents specified as an HTML string. This will be seen as at least two events, n inserts followed by a remove. Consider the following structure (the elem parameter is in bold).        <body>         |       <div>        /  \      <p>   <p>   Invoking setInnerHTML(elem, "<ul><li>") results in the following structure (new elements are in red).        <body>         |       <div>           \           <ul>             \             <li>   Parameter elem must not be a leaf element, otherwise an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. If either elem or htmlText parameter is null, no changes are made to the document. For this to work correcty, the document must have an HTMLEditorKit.Parser set. This will be the case if the document was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the createDefaultDocument method.

					public void setOuterHTML(Element elem,                  String htmlText)                    throws BadLocationException,                           IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Replaces the given element in the parent with the contents specified as an HTML string. This will be seen as at least two events, n inserts followed by a remove. When replacing a leaf this will attempt to make sure there is a newline present if one is needed. This may result in an additional element being inserted. Consider, if you were to replace a character element that contained a newline with <img> this would create two elements, one for the image, ane one for the newline. If you try to replace the element at length you will most likely end up with two elements, eg setOuterHTML(getCharacterElement (getLength()), "blah") will result in two leaf elements at the end, one representing 'blah', and the other representing the end element. Consider the following structure (the elem parameter is in bold).        <body>         |       <div>        /  \      <p>   <p>   Invoking setOuterHTML(elem, "<ul><li>") results in the following structure (new elements are in red).       <body>        |       <ul>         \         <li>   If either elem or htmlText parameter is null, no changes are made to the document. For this to work correcty, the document must have an HTMLEditorKit.Parser set. This will be the case if the document was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the createDefaultDocument method.

				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts the HTML specified as a string at the start of the element. Consider the following structure (the elem parameter is in bold).        <body>         |       <div>        /  \      <p>   <p>   Invoking insertAfterStart(elem, "<ul><li>") results in the following structure (new elements are in red).           <body>            |          <div>         /  |  \      <ul> <p> <p>       /    <li>   Unlike the insertBeforeStart method, new elements become children of the specified element, not siblings. Parameter elem must not be a leaf element, otherwise an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. If either elem or htmlText parameter is null, no changes are made to the document. For this to work correcty, the document must have an HTMLEditorKit.Parser set. This will be the case if the document was created from an HTMLEditorKit via the createDefaultDocument method.

				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts the HTML specified as a string at the end of the element. If elem's children are leaves, and the character at a elem.getEndOffset() - 1 is a newline, this will insert before the newline so that there isn't text after the newline. Consider the following structure (the elem parameter is in bold).        <body>         |       <div>        /  \      <p>   <p>   Invoking insertBeforeEnd(elem, "<ul><li>") results in the following structure (new elements are in red).           <body>            |          <div>         /  |  \       <p> <p> <ul>                 \                 <li>   Unlike the insertAfterEnd method, new elements become children of the specified element, not siblings. Parameter elem must not be a leaf element, otherwise an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. If either elem or htmlText parameter is null, no changes are made to the document.
