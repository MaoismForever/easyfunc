			public class CropImageFilter  extends ImageFilter
		</name>
		<description>
			An ImageFilter class for cropping images. This class extends the basic ImageFilter Class to extract a given rectangular region of an existing Image and provide a source for a new image containing just the extracted region. It is meant to be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource object to produce cropped versions of existing images.

					public CropImageFilter(int x,                 int y,                 int w,                 int h)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a CropImageFilter that extracts the absolute rectangular region of pixels from its source Image as specified by the x, y, w, and h parameters.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setProperties(Hashtable<?,?> props)
				</name>
				<description>
					Passes along the properties from the source object after adding a property indicating the cropped region. This method invokes super.setProperties, which might result in additional properties being added. Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered. Developers using this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling this method directly since that operation could interfere with the filtering operation.

					public void setDimensions(int w,                   int h)
				</name>
				<description>
					Override the source image's dimensions and pass the dimensions of the rectangular cropped region to the ImageConsumer. Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered. Developers using this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling this method directly since that operation could interfere with the filtering operation.

					public void setPixels(int x,               int y,               int w,               int h,               ColorModel model,               byte[] pixels,               int off,               int scansize)
				</name>
				<description>
					Determine whether the delivered byte pixels intersect the region to be extracted and passes through only that subset of pixels that appear in the output region. Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered. Developers using this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling this method directly since that operation could interfere with the filtering operation.

					Determine if the delivered int pixels intersect the region to be extracted and pass through only that subset of pixels that appear in the output region. Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered. Developers using this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling this method directly since that operation could interfere with the filtering operation.
