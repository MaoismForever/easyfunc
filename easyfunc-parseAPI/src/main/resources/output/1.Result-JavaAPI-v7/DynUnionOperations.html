		<description>
			DynUnion objects support the manipulation of IDL unions. A union can have only two valid current positions: zero, which denotes the discriminator one, which denotes the active member The component_count value for a union depends on the current discriminator: it is 2 for a union whose discriminator indicates a named member, and 1 otherwise.

			<method>
				<name>
					DynAny get_discriminator()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the current discriminator value.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void set_discriminator(DynAny d)                         throws TypeMismatch
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the discriminator of the DynUnion to the specified value. Setting the discriminator to a value that is consistent with the currently active union member does not affect the currently active member. Setting the discriminator to a value that is inconsistent with the currently active member deactivates the member and activates the member that is consistent with the new discriminator value (if there is a member for that value) by initializing the member to its default value. Setting the discriminator of a union sets the current position to 0 if the discriminator value indicates a non-existent union member (has_no_active_member returns true in this case). Otherwise, if the discriminator value indicates a named union member, the current position is set to 1 (has_no_active_member returns false and component_count returns 2 in this case).

				<name>
					void set_to_default_member()                             throws TypeMismatch
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the discriminator to a value that is consistent with the value of the default case of a union. It sets the current position to zero and causes component_count to return 2.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void set_to_no_active_member()                               throws TypeMismatch
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the discriminator to a value that does not correspond to any of the unions case labels. It sets the current position to zero and causes component_count to return 1.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean has_no_active_member()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the union has no active member, that is, the unions value consists solely of its discriminator because the discriminator has a value that is not listed as an explicit case label. Calling this operation on a union that has a default case returns false. Calling this operation on a union that uses the entire range of discriminator values for explicit case labels returns false.

			<method>
				<name>
					TCKind discriminator_kind()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the TCKind value of the discriminators TypeCode.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					TCKind member_kind()                     throws InvalidValue
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the TCKind value of the currently active members TypeCode.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					DynAny member()                throws InvalidValue
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the currently active member. Note that the returned reference remains valid only for as long as the currently active member does not change. Using the returned reference beyond the life time of the currently active member raises OBJECT_NOT_EXIST.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					String member_name()                     throws InvalidValue
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the name of the currently active member. If the unions TypeCode does not contain a member name for the currently active member, the operation returns an empty string.
