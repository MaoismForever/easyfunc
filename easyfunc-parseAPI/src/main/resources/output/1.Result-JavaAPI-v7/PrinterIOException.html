		<description>
			The PrinterIOException class is a subclass of PrinterException and is used to indicate that an IO error of some sort has occurred while printing. As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to the general purpose exception-chaining mechanism. The "IOException that terminated the print job" that is provided at construction time and accessed via the getIOException() method is now known as the cause, and may be accessed via the Throwable.getCause() method, as well as the aforementioned "legacy method."
