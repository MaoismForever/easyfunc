				<description>
					Sets the MBean server on which the query is to be performed. The setting is valid for the thread performing the set. It is copied to any threads created by that thread at the moment of their creation. For historical reasons, this method is not static, but its behavior does not depend on the instance on which it is called.

				<description>
					Return the MBean server that was most recently given to the setMBeanServer method by this thread. If this thread never called that method, the result is the value its parent thread would have obtained from getMBeanServer at the moment of the creation of this thread, or null if there is no parent thread.
