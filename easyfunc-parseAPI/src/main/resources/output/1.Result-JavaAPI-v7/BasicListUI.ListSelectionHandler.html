			The ListSelectionListener that's added to the JLists selection model at installUI time, and whenever the JList.selectionModel property changes. When the selection changes we repaint the affected rows. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
