			The permission which the SecurityManager will check when code that is running with a SecurityManager calls methods defined in the management interface for the Java platform. The following table provides a summary description of what the permission allows, and discusses the risks of granting code the permission. Permission Target Name What the Permission Allows Risks of Allowing this Permission control Ability to control the runtime characteristics of the Java virtual machine, for example, setting the -verbose:gc and -verbose:class flag, setting the threshold of a memory pool, and enabling and disabling the thread contention monitoring support. This allows an attacker to control the runtime characteristics of the Java virtual machine and cause the system to misbehave. monitor Ability to retrieve runtime information about the Java virtual machine such as thread stack trace, a list of all loaded class names, and input arguments to the Java virtual machine. This allows malicious code to monitor runtime information and uncover vulnerabilities. Programmers do not normally create ManagementPermission objects directly. Instead they are created by the security policy code based on reading the security policy file.
