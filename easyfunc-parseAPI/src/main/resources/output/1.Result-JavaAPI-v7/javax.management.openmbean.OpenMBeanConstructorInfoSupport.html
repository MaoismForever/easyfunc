		<description>
			Describes a constructor of an Open MBean.

					public OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport(String name,                                 String description,                                 OpenMBeanParameterInfo[] signature)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instance, which describes the constructor of a class of open MBeans with the specified name, description and signature. The signature array parameter is internally copied, so that subsequent changes to the array referenced by signature have no effect on this instance.

				<description>
					Constructs an OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instance, which describes the constructor of a class of open MBeans with the specified name, description, signature, and descriptor. The signature array parameter is internally copied, so that subsequent changes to the array referenced by signature have no effect on this instance.

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean equals(Object obj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares the specified obj parameter with this OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instance for equality. Returns true if and only if all of the following statements are true: obj is non null, obj also implements the OpenMBeanConstructorInfo interface, their names are equal their signatures are equal. This ensures that this equals method works properly for obj parameters which are different implementations of the OpenMBeanConstructorInfo interface.

			<method>
				<name>
					public int hashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the hash code value for this OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instance. The hash code of an OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instance is the sum of the hash codes of all elements of information used in equals comparisons (ie: its name and signature, where the signature hashCode is calculated by a call to java.util.Arrays.asList(this.getSignature).hashCode()). This ensures that t1.equals(t2) implies that t1.hashCode()==t2.hashCode() for any two OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instances t1 and t2, as required by the general contract of the method Object.hashCode(). However, note that another instance of a class implementing the OpenMBeanConstructorInfo interface may be equal to this OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instance as defined by equals(java.lang.Object), but may have a different hash code if it is calculated differently. As OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instances are immutable, the hash code for this instance is calculated once, on the first call to hashCode, and then the same value is returned for subsequent calls.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instance. The string representation consists of the name of this class (ie javax.management.openmbean.OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport), the name and signature of the described constructor and the string representation of its descriptor. As OpenMBeanConstructorInfoSupport instances are immutable, the string representation for this instance is calculated once, on the first call to toString, and then the same value is returned for subsequent calls.
