		<description>
			DOMErrorHandler is a callback interface that the DOM implementation can call when reporting errors that happens while processing XML data, or when doing some other processing (e.g. validating a document). A DOMErrorHandler object can be attached to a Document using the "error-handler" on the DOMConfiguration interface. If more than one error needs to be reported during an operation, the sequence and numbers of the errors passed to the error handler are implementation dependent. The application that is using the DOM implementation is expected to implement this interface. See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification.
