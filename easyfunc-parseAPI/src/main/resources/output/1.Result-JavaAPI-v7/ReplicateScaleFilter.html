			public class ReplicateScaleFilter  extends ImageFilter
		</name>
		<description>
			An ImageFilter class for scaling images using the simplest algorithm. This class extends the basic ImageFilter Class to scale an existing image and provide a source for a new image containing the resampled image. The pixels in the source image are sampled to produce pixels for an image of the specified size by replicating rows and columns of pixels to scale up or omitting rows and columns of pixels to scale down. It is meant to be used in conjunction with a FilteredImageSource object to produce scaled versions of existing images. Due to implementation dependencies, there may be differences in pixel values of an image filtered on different platforms.

			<method>
				<name>
					public ReplicateScaleFilter(int width,                      int height)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a ReplicateScaleFilter that scales the pixels from its source Image as specified by the width and height parameters.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setProperties(Hashtable<?,?> props)
				</name>
				<description>
					Passes along the properties from the source object after adding a property indicating the scale applied. This method invokes super.setProperties, which might result in additional properties being added. Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered. Developers using this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling this method directly since that operation could interfere with the filtering operation.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setDimensions(int w,                   int h)
				</name>
				<description>
					Override the dimensions of the source image and pass the dimensions of the new scaled size to the ImageConsumer. Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered. Developers using this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling this method directly since that operation could interfere with the filtering operation.

				</name>
				<description>
					Choose which rows and columns of the delivered byte pixels are needed for the destination scaled image and pass through just those rows and columns that are needed, replicated as necessary. Note: This method is intended to be called by the ImageProducer of the Image whose pixels are being filtered. Developers using this class to filter pixels from an image should avoid calling this method directly since that operation could interfere with the filtering operation.
