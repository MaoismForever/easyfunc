		</name>
		<description>
			A Method provides information about, and access to, a single method on a class or interface. The reflected method may be a class method or an instance method (including an abstract method). A Method permits widening conversions to occur when matching the actual parameters to invoke with the underlying method's formal parameters, but it throws an IllegalArgumentException if a narrowing conversion would occur.

					public Type getGenericReturnType()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Type object that represents the formal return type of the method represented by this Method object. If the return type is a parameterized type, the Type object returned must accurately reflect the actual type parameters used in the source code. If the return type is a type variable or a parameterized type, it is created. Otherwise, it is resolved.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of Type objects that represent the formal parameter types, in declaration order, of the method represented by this Method object. Returns an array of length 0 if the underlying method takes no parameters. If a formal parameter type is a parameterized type, the Type object returned for it must accurately reflect the actual type parameters used in the source code. If a formal parameter type is a type variable or a parameterized type, it is created. Otherwise, it is resolved.

			<method>
				<name>
					public String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string describing this Method. The string is formatted as the method access modifiers, if any, followed by the method return type, followed by a space, followed by the class declaring the method, followed by a period, followed by the method name, followed by a parenthesized, comma-separated list of the method's formal parameter types. If the method throws checked exceptions, the parameter list is followed by a space, followed by the word throws followed by a comma-separated list of the thrown exception types. For example:       public boolean java.lang.Object.equals(java.lang.Object)   The access modifiers are placed in canonical order as specified by "The Java Language Specification". This is public, protected or private first, and then other modifiers in the following order: abstract, static, final, synchronized, native, strictfp.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String toGenericString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string describing this Method, including type parameters. The string is formatted as the method access modifiers, if any, followed by an angle-bracketed comma-separated list of the method's type parameters, if any, followed by the method's generic return type, followed by a space, followed by the class declaring the method, followed by a period, followed by the method name, followed by a parenthesized, comma-separated list of the method's generic formal parameter types. If this method was declared to take a variable number of arguments, instead of denoting the last parameter as "Type[]", it is denoted as "Type...". A space is used to separate access modifiers from one another and from the type parameters or return type. If there are no type parameters, the type parameter list is elided; if the type parameter list is present, a space separates the list from the class name. If the method is declared to throw exceptions, the parameter list is followed by a space, followed by the word throws followed by a comma-separated list of the generic thrown exception types. If there are no type parameters, the type parameter list is elided. The access modifiers are placed in canonical order as specified by "The Java Language Specification". This is public, protected or private first, and then other modifiers in the following order: abstract, static, final, synchronized, native, strictfp.

				<name>
					public Object invoke(Object obj,              Object... args)                throws IllegalAccessException,                       IllegalArgumentException,                       InvocationTargetException
				</name>
				<description>
					Invokes the underlying method represented by this Method object, on the specified object with the specified parameters. Individual parameters are automatically unwrapped to match primitive formal parameters, and both primitive and reference parameters are subject to method invocation conversions as necessary. If the underlying method is static, then the specified obj argument is ignored. It may be null. If the number of formal parameters required by the underlying method is 0, the supplied args array may be of length 0 or null. If the underlying method is an instance method, it is invoked using dynamic method lookup as documented in The Java Language Specification, Second Edition, section 15.12.4.4; in particular, overriding based on the runtime type of the target object will occur. If the underlying method is static, the class that declared the method is initialized if it has not already been initialized. If the method completes normally, the value it returns is returned to the caller of invoke; if the value has a primitive type, it is first appropriately wrapped in an object. However, if the value has the type of an array of a primitive type, the elements of the array are not wrapped in objects; in other words, an array of primitive type is returned. If the underlying method return type is void, the invocation returns null.

			<method>
				<name>
					public <T extends Annotation> T getAnnotation(Class<T> annotationClass)
				</name>

					Description copied from interface: AnnotatedElement Returns this element's annotation for the specified type if such an annotation is present, else null.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Annotation[] getDeclaredAnnotations()
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: AnnotatedElement Returns all annotations that are directly present on this element. Unlike the other methods in this interface, this method ignores inherited annotations. (Returns an array of length zero if no annotations are directly present on this element.) The caller of this method is free to modify the returned array; it will have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Object getDefaultValue()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the default value for the annotation member represented by this Method instance. If the member is of a primitive type, an instance of the corresponding wrapper type is returned. Returns null if no default is associated with the member, or if the method instance does not represent a declared member of an annotation type.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Annotation[][] getParameterAnnotations()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of arrays that represent the annotations on the formal parameters, in declaration order, of the method represented by this Method object. (Returns an array of length zero if the underlying method is parameterless. If the method has one or more parameters, a nested array of length zero is returned for each parameter with no annotations.) The annotation objects contained in the returned arrays are serializable. The caller of this method is free to modify the returned arrays; it will have no effect on the arrays returned to other callers.
