			The Font class represents fonts, which are used to render text in a visible way. A font provides the information needed to map sequences of characters to sequences of glyphs and to render sequences of glyphs on Graphics and Component objects. Characters and Glyphs A character is a symbol that represents an item such as a letter, a digit, or punctuation in an abstract way. For example, 'g', LATIN SMALL LETTER G, is a character. A glyph is a shape used to render a character or a sequence of characters. In simple writing systems, such as Latin, typically one glyph represents one character. In general, however, characters and glyphs do not have one-to-one correspondence. For example, the character 'á' LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH ACUTE, can be represented by two glyphs: one for 'a' and one for '´'. On the other hand, the two-character string "fi" can be represented by a single glyph, an "fi" ligature. In complex writing systems, such as Arabic or the South and South-East Asian writing systems, the relationship between characters and glyphs can be more complicated and involve context-dependent selection of glyphs as well as glyph reordering. A font encapsulates the collection of glyphs needed to render a selected set of characters as well as the tables needed to map sequences of characters to corresponding sequences of glyphs. Physical and Logical Fonts The Java Platform distinguishes between two kinds of fonts: physical fonts and logical fonts. Physical fonts are the actual font libraries containing glyph data and tables to map from character sequences to glyph sequences, using a font technology such as TrueType or PostScript Type 1. All implementations of the Java Platform must support TrueType fonts; support for other font technologies is implementation dependent. Physical fonts may use names such as Helvetica, Palatino, HonMincho, or any number of other font names. Typically, each physical font supports only a limited set of writing systems, for example, only Latin characters or only Japanese and Basic Latin. The set of available physical fonts varies between configurations. Applications that require specific fonts can bundle them and instantiate them using the createFont method. Logical fonts are the five font families defined by the Java platform which must be supported by any Java runtime environment: Serif, SansSerif, Monospaced, Dialog, and DialogInput. These logical fonts are not actual font libraries. Instead, the logical font names are mapped to physical fonts by the Java runtime environment. The mapping is implementation and usually locale dependent, so the look and the metrics provided by them vary. Typically, each logical font name maps to several physical fonts in order to cover a large range of characters. Peered AWT components, such as Label and TextField, can only use logical fonts. For a discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of using physical or logical fonts, see the Internationalization FAQ document. Font Faces and Names A Font can have many faces, such as heavy, medium, oblique, gothic and regular. All of these faces have similar typographic design. There are three different names that you can get from a Font object. The logical font name is simply the name that was used to construct the font. The font face name, or just font name for short, is the name of a particular font face, like Helvetica Bold. The family name is the name of the font family that determines the typographic design across several faces, like Helvetica. The Font class represents an instance of a font face from a collection of font faces that are present in the system resources of the host system. As examples, Arial Bold and Courier Bold Italic are font faces. There can be several Font objects associated with a font face, each differing in size, style, transform and font features. The getAllFonts method of the GraphicsEnvironment class returns an array of all font faces available in the system. These font faces are returned as Font objects with a size of 1, identity transform and default font features. These base fonts can then be used to derive new Font objects with varying sizes, styles, transforms and font features via the deriveFont methods in this class. Font and TextAttribute Font supports most TextAttributes. This makes some operations, such as rendering underlined text, convenient since it is not necessary to explicitly construct a TextLayout object. Attributes can be set on a Font by constructing or deriving it using a Map of TextAttribute values. The values of some TextAttributes are not serializable, and therefore attempting to serialize an instance of Font that has such values will not serialize them. This means a Font deserialized from such a stream will not compare equal to the original Font that contained the non-serializable attributes. This should very rarely pose a problem since these attributes are typically used only in special circumstances and are unlikely to be serialized. FOREGROUND and BACKGROUND use Paint values. The subclass Color is serializable, while GradientPaint and TexturePaint are not. CHAR_REPLACEMENT uses GraphicAttribute values. The subclasses ShapeGraphicAttribute and ImageGraphicAttribute are not serializable. INPUT_METHOD_HIGHLIGHT uses InputMethodHighlight values, which are not serializable. See InputMethodHighlight. Clients who create custom subclasses of Paint and GraphicAttribute can make them serializable and avoid this problem. Clients who use input method highlights can convert these to the platform-specific attributes for that highlight on the current platform and set them on the Font as a workaround. The Map-based constructor and deriveFont APIs ignore the FONT attribute, and it is not retained by the Font; the static getFont(java.util.Map<? extends java.text.AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute, ?>) method should be used if the FONT attribute might be present. See TextAttribute.FONT for more information. Several attributes will cause additional rendering overhead and potentially invoke layout. If a Font has such attributes, the hasLayoutAttributes() method will return true. Note: Font rotations can cause text baselines to be rotated. In order to account for this (rare) possibility, font APIs are specified to return metrics and take parameters 'in baseline-relative coordinates'. This maps the 'x' coordinate to the advance along the baseline, (positive x is forward along the baseline), and the 'y' coordinate to a distance along the perpendicular to the baseline at 'x' (positive y is 90 degrees clockwise from the baseline vector). APIs for which this is especially important are called out as having 'baseline-relative coordinates.'

			<method>
				<name>
					public Font(String name,      int style,      int size)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a new Font from the specified name, style and point size. The font name can be a font face name or a font family name. It is used together with the style to find an appropriate font face. When a font family name is specified, the style argument is used to select the most appropriate face from the family. When a font face name is specified, the face's style and the style argument are merged to locate the best matching font from the same family. For example if face name "Arial Bold" is specified with style Font.ITALIC, the font system looks for a face in the "Arial" family that is bold and italic, and may associate the font instance with the physical font face "Arial Bold Italic". The style argument is merged with the specified face's style, not added or subtracted. This means, specifying a bold face and a bold style does not double-embolden the font, and specifying a bold face and a plain style does not lighten the font. If no face for the requested style can be found, the font system may apply algorithmic styling to achieve the desired style. For example, if ITALIC is requested, but no italic face is available, glyphs from the plain face may be algorithmically obliqued (slanted). Font name lookup is case insensitive, using the case folding rules of the US locale. If the name parameter represents something other than a logical font, i.e. is interpreted as a physical font face or family, and this cannot be mapped by the implementation to a physical font or a compatible alternative, then the font system will map the Font instance to "Dialog", such that for example, the family as reported by getFamily will be "Dialog".

			<method>
				<name>
					public String getFamily()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the family name of this Font. The family name of a font is font specific. Two fonts such as Helvetica Italic and Helvetica Bold have the same family name, Helvetica, whereas their font face names are Helvetica Bold and Helvetica Italic.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getSize()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the point size of this Font, rounded to an integer. Most users are familiar with the idea of using point size to specify the size of glyphs in a font. This point size defines a measurement between the baseline of one line to the baseline of the following line in a single spaced text document. The point size is based on typographic points, approximately 1/72 of an inch. The Java(tm)2D API adopts the convention that one point is equivalent to one unit in user coordinates. When using a normalized transform for converting user space coordinates to device space coordinates 72 user space units equal 1 inch in device space. In this case one point is 1/72 of an inch.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static Font getFont(String nm)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Font object from the system properties list. nm is treated as the name of a system property to be obtained. The String value of this property is then interpreted as a Font object according to the specification of Font.decode(String) If the specified property is not found, or the executing code does not have permission to read the property, null is returned instead.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static Font decode(String str)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the Font that the str argument describes. To ensure that this method returns the desired Font, format the str parameter in one of these ways fontname-style-pointsize fontname-pointsize fontname-style fontname fontname style pointsize fontname pointsize fontname style fontname in which style is one of the four case-insensitive strings: "PLAIN", "BOLD", "BOLDITALIC", or "ITALIC", and pointsize is a positive decimal integer representation of the point size. For example, if you want a font that is Arial, bold, with a point size of 18, you would call this method with: "Arial-BOLD-18". This is equivalent to calling the Font constructor : new Font("Arial", Font.BOLD, 18); and the values are interpreted as specified by that constructor. A valid trailing decimal field is always interpreted as the pointsize. Therefore a fontname containing a trailing decimal value should not be used in the fontname only form. If a style name field is not one of the valid style strings, it is interpreted as part of the font name, and the default style is used. Only one of ' ' or '-' may be used to separate fields in the input. The identified separator is the one closest to the end of the string which separates a valid pointsize, or a valid style name from the rest of the string. Null (empty) pointsize and style fields are treated as valid fields with the default value for that field. Some font names may include the separator characters ' ' or '-'. If str is not formed with 3 components, e.g. such that style or pointsize fields are not present in str, and fontname also contains a character determined to be the separator character then these characters where they appear as intended to be part of fontname may instead be interpreted as separators so the font name may not be properly recognised. The default size is 12 and the default style is PLAIN. If str does not specify a valid size, the returned Font has a size of 12. If str does not specify a valid style, the returned Font has a style of PLAIN. If you do not specify a valid font name in the str argument, this method will return a font with the family name "Dialog". To determine what font family names are available on your system, use the GraphicsEnvironment.getAvailableFontFamilyNames() method. If str is null, a new Font is returned with the family name "Dialog", a size of 12 and a PLAIN style.

				<name>
					public static Font getFont(String nm,             Font font)
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the specified Font from the system properties list. As in the getProperty method of System, the first argument is treated as the name of a system property to be obtained. The String value of this property is then interpreted as a Font object. The property value should be one of the forms accepted by Font.decode(String) If the specified property is not found, or the executing code does not have permission to read the property, the font argument is returned instead.

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the logical bounds of the specified String in the specified FontRenderContext. The logical bounds contains the origin, ascent, advance, and height, which includes the leading. The logical bounds does not always enclose all the text. For example, in some languages and in some fonts, accent marks can be positioned above the ascent or below the descent. To obtain a visual bounding box, which encloses all the text, use the getBounds method of TextLayout. Note: The returned bounds is in baseline-relative coordinates (see class notes).

				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a new GlyphVector object, performing full layout of the text if possible. Full layout is required for complex text, such as Arabic or Hindi. Support for different scripts depends on the font and implementation. Layout requires bidi analysis, as performed by Bidi, and should only be performed on text that has a uniform direction. The direction is indicated in the flags parameter,by using LAYOUT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT to indicate a right-to-left (Arabic and Hebrew) run direction, or LAYOUT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT to indicate a left-to-right (English) run direction. In addition, some operations, such as Arabic shaping, require context, so that the characters at the start and limit can have the proper shapes. Sometimes the data in the buffer outside the provided range does not have valid data. The values LAYOUT_NO_START_CONTEXT and LAYOUT_NO_LIMIT_CONTEXT can be added to the flags parameter to indicate that the text before start, or after limit, respectively, should not be examined for context. All other values for the flags parameter are reserved.
