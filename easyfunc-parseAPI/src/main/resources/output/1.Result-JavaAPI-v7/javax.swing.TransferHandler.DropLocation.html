			public static class TransferHandler.DropLocation  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			Represents a location where dropped data should be inserted. This is a base class that only encapsulates a point. Components supporting drop may provide subclasses of this containing more information. Developers typically shouldn't create instances of, or extend, this class. Instead, these are something provided by the DnD implementation by TransferSupport instances and by components with a getDropLocation() method.
