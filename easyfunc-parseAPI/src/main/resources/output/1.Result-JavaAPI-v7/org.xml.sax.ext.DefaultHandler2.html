			public class DefaultHandler2  extends DefaultHandler  implements LexicalHandler, DeclHandler, EntityResolver2
		</name>
		<description>
			This class extends the SAX2 base handler class to support the SAX2 LexicalHandler, DeclHandler, and EntityResolver2 extensions. Except for overriding the original SAX1 resolveEntity() method the added handler methods just return. Subclassers may override everything on a method-by-method basis. This module, both source code and documentation, is in the Public Domain, and comes with NO WARRANTY. Note: this class might yet learn that the ContentHandler.setDocumentLocator() call might be passed a Locator2 object, and that the ContentHandler.startElement() call might be passed a Attributes2 object.

					Description copied from interface: LexicalHandler Report the start of a CDATA section. The contents of the CDATA section will be reported through the regular characters event; this event is intended only to report the boundary.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: LexicalHandler Report the start of DTD declarations, if any. This method is intended to report the beginning of the DOCTYPE declaration; if the document has no DOCTYPE declaration, this method will not be invoked. All declarations reported through DTDHandler or DeclHandler events must appear between the startDTD and endDTD events. Declarations are assumed to belong to the internal DTD subset unless they appear between startEntity and endEntity events. Comments and processing instructions from the DTD should also be reported between the startDTD and endDTD events, in their original order of (logical) occurrence; they are not required to appear in their correct locations relative to DTDHandler or DeclHandler events, however. Note that the start/endDTD events will appear within the start/endDocument events from ContentHandler and before the first startElement event.

					public void startEntity(String name)                   throws SAXException
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: LexicalHandler Report the beginning of some internal and external XML entities. The reporting of parameter entities (including the external DTD subset) is optional, and SAX2 drivers that report LexicalHandler events may not implement it; you can use the http://xml.org/sax/features/lexical-handler/parameter-entities feature to query or control the reporting of parameter entities. General entities are reported with their regular names, parameter entities have '%' prepended to their names, and the external DTD subset has the pseudo-entity name "[dtd]". When a SAX2 driver is providing these events, all other events must be properly nested within start/end entity events. There is no additional requirement that events from DeclHandler or DTDHandler be properly ordered. Note that skipped entities will be reported through the skippedEntity event, which is part of the ContentHandler interface. Because of the streaming event model that SAX uses, some entity boundaries cannot be reported under any circumstances: general entities within attribute values parameter entities within declarations These will be silently expanded, with no indication of where the original entity boundaries were. Note also that the boundaries of character references (which are not really entities anyway) are not reported. All start/endEntity events must be properly nested.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: LexicalHandler Report an XML comment anywhere in the document. This callback will be used for comments inside or outside the document element, including comments in the external DTD subset (if read). Comments in the DTD must be properly nested inside start/endDTD and start/endEntity events (if used).

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: DeclHandler Report an attribute type declaration. Only the effective (first) declaration for an attribute will be reported. The type will be one of the strings "CDATA", "ID", "IDREF", "IDREFS", "NMTOKEN", "NMTOKENS", "ENTITY", "ENTITIES", a parenthesized token group with the separator "|" and all whitespace removed, or the word "NOTATION" followed by a space followed by a parenthesized token group with all whitespace removed. The value will be the value as reported to applications, appropriately normalized and with entity and character references expanded.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: DeclHandler Report an element type declaration. The content model will consist of the string "EMPTY", the string "ANY", or a parenthesised group, optionally followed by an occurrence indicator. The model will be normalized so that all parameter entities are fully resolved and all whitespace is removed,and will include the enclosing parentheses. Other normalization (such as removing redundant parentheses or simplifying occurrence indicators) is at the discretion of the parser.

				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: DeclHandler Report a parsed external entity declaration. Only the effective (first) declaration for each entity will be reported. If the system identifier is a URL, the parser must resolve it fully before passing it to the application.

				<description>
					Description copied from interface: DeclHandler Report an internal entity declaration. Only the effective (first) declaration for each entity will be reported. All parameter entities in the value will be expanded, but general entities will not.

				</name>
				<description>
					Tells the parser to resolve the systemId against the baseURI and read the entity text from that resulting absolute URI. Note that because the older DefaultHandler.resolveEntity(), method is overridden to call this one, this method may sometimes be invoked with null name and baseURI, and with the systemId already absolutized.

				<description>
					Invokes EntityResolver2.resolveEntity() with null entity name and base URI. You only need to override that method to use this class.
