		<description>
			This class is part of the local stub API, the purpose of which is to provide high performance calls for collocated clients and servers (i.e. clients and servers residing in the same Java VM). The local stub API is supported via three additional methods on ObjectImpl and Delegate. ORB vendors may subclass this class to return additional request state that may be required by their implementations.
