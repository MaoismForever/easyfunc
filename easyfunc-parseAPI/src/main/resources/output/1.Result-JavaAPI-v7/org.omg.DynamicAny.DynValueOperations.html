		<description>
			DynValue objects support the manipulation of IDL non-boxed value types. The DynValue interface can represent both null and non-null value types. For a DynValue representing a non-null value type, the DynValue's components comprise the public and private members of the value type, including those inherited from concrete base value types, in the order of definition. A DynValue representing a null value type has no components and a current position of -1. Warning: Indiscriminantly changing the contents of private value type members can cause the value type implementation to break by violating internal constraints. Access to private members is provided to support such activities as ORB bridging and debugging and should not be used to arbitrarily violate the encapsulation of the value type.

				<name>
					String current_member_name()                             throws TypeMismatch,                                    InvalidValue
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the name of the member at the current position. This operation may return an empty string since the TypeCode of the value being manipulated may not contain the names of members.

					TCKind current_member_kind()                             throws TypeMismatch,                                    InvalidValue
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the TCKind associated with the member at the current position.

					NameValuePair[] get_members()                              throws InvalidValue
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a sequence of NameValuePairs describing the name and the value of each member in the value type. The sequence contains members in the same order as the declaration order of members as indicated by the DynValue's TypeCode. The current position is not affected. The member names in the returned sequence will be empty strings if the DynValue's TypeCode does not contain member names.

					void set_members(NameValuePair[] value)                   throws TypeMismatch,                          InvalidValue
				</name>
				<description>
					Initializes the value type's members from a sequence of NameValuePairs. The operation sets the current position to zero if the passed sequences has non-zero length. Otherwise, if an empty sequence is passed, the current position is set to -1. A null value type can be initialized to a non-null value type using this method. Members must appear in the NameValuePairs in the order in which they appear in the IDL specification of the value type as indicated by the DynValue's TypeCode or they must be empty strings. The operation makes no attempt to assign member values based on member names.

				<description>
					Returns a sequence of NameDynAnyPairs describing the name and the value of each member in the value type. The sequence contains members in the same order as the declaration order of members as indicated by the DynValue's TypeCode. The current position is not affected. The member names in the returned sequence will be empty strings if the DynValue's TypeCode does not contain member names.

				<description>
					Initializes the value type's members from a sequence of NameDynAnyPairs. The operation sets the current position to zero if the passed sequences has non-zero length. Otherwise, if an empty sequence is passed, the current position is set to -1. A null value type can be initialized to a non-null value type using this method. Members must appear in the NameDynAnyPairs in the order in which they appear in the IDL specification of the value type as indicated by the DynValue's TypeCode or they must be empty strings. The operation makes no attempt to assign member values based on member names.
