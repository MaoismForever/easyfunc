			public interface SSLSessionBindingListener  extends EventListener

		<description>
			This interface is implemented by objects which want to know when they are being bound or unbound from a SSLSession. When either event occurs via SSLSession.putValue(String, Object) or SSLSession.removeValue(String), the event is communicated through a SSLSessionBindingEvent identifying the session.
