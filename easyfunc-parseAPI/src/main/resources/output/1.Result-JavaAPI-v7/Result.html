		</name>
		<description>
			An object that implements this interface contains the information needed to build a transformation result tree.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					static final String PI_DISABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of the processing instruction that is sent if the result tree disables output escaping. Normally, result tree serialization escapes & and < (and possibly other characters) when outputting text nodes. This ensures that the output is well-formed XML. However, it is sometimes convenient to be able to produce output that is almost, but not quite well-formed XML; for example, the output may include ill-formed sections that will be transformed into well-formed XML by a subsequent non-XML aware process. If a processing instruction is sent with this name, serialization should be output without any escaping. Result DOM trees may also have PI_DISABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING and PI_ENABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING inserted into the tree.

			<method>
				<name>
					static final String PI_ENABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING
				</name>
				<description>
					The name of the processing instruction that is sent if the result tree enables output escaping at some point after having received a PI_DISABLE_OUTPUT_ESCAPING processing instruction.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void setSystemId(String systemId)
				</name>
				<description>
					Set the system identifier for this Result. If the Result is not to be written to a file, the system identifier is optional. The application may still want to provide one, however, for use in error messages and warnings, or to resolve relative output identifiers.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					String getSystemId()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.
