		<description>
			The RemoteServer class is the common superclass to server implementations and provides the framework to support a wide range of remote reference semantics. Specifically, the functions needed to create and export remote objects (i.e. to make them remotely available) are provided abstractly by RemoteServer and concretely by its subclass(es).
