			public class X509CertSelector  extends Object  implements CertSelector
		</name>
		<description>
			A CertSelector that selects X509Certificates that match all specified criteria. This class is particularly useful when selecting certificates from a CertStore to build a PKIX-compliant certification path. When first constructed, an X509CertSelector has no criteria enabled and each of the get methods return a default value (null, or -1 for the getBasicConstraints method). Therefore, the match method would return true for any X509Certificate. Typically, several criteria are enabled (by calling setIssuer or setKeyUsage, for instance) and then the X509CertSelector is passed to CertStore.getCertificates or some similar method. Several criteria can be enabled (by calling setIssuer and setSerialNumber, for example) such that the match method usually uniquely matches a single X509Certificate. We say usually, since it is possible for two issuing CAs to have the same distinguished name and each issue a certificate with the same serial number. Other unique combinations include the issuer, subject, subjectKeyIdentifier and/or the subjectPublicKey criteria. Please refer to RFC 3280: Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile for definitions of the X.509 certificate extensions mentioned below. Concurrent Access Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not thread-safe. Multiple threads that need to access a single object concurrently should synchronize amongst themselves and provide the necessary locking. Multiple threads each manipulating separate objects need not synchronize.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public X509CertSelector()
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates an X509CertSelector. Initially, no criteria are set so any X509Certificate will match.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setCertificate(X509Certificate cert)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the certificateEquals criterion. The specified X509Certificate must be equal to the X509Certificate passed to the match method. If null, then this check is not applied. This method is particularly useful when it is necessary to match a single certificate. Although other criteria can be specified in conjunction with the certificateEquals criterion, it is usually not practical or necessary.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setSerialNumber(BigInteger serial)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the serialNumber criterion. The specified serial number must match the certificate serial number in the X509Certificate. If null, any certificate serial number will do.
				</description>

				<name>
					public void setIssuer(X500Principal issuer)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the issuer criterion. The specified distinguished name must match the issuer distinguished name in the X509Certificate. If null, any issuer distinguished name will do.

					public void setIssuer(String issuerDN)                 throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Denigrated, use setIssuer(X500Principal) or setIssuer(byte[]) instead. This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253 String form of some distinguished names. Sets the issuer criterion. The specified distinguished name must match the issuer distinguished name in the X509Certificate. If null, any issuer distinguished name will do. If issuerDN is not null, it should contain a distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setIssuer(byte[] issuerDN)                 throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the issuer criterion. The specified distinguished name must match the issuer distinguished name in the X509Certificate. If null is specified, the issuer criterion is disabled and any issuer distinguished name will do. If issuerDN is not null, it should contain a single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is as follows.    Name ::= CHOICE {     RDNSequence }     RDNSequence ::= SEQUENCE OF RelativeDistinguishedName     RelativeDistinguishedName ::=     SET SIZE (1 .. MAX) OF AttributeTypeAndValue     AttributeTypeAndValue ::= SEQUENCE {     type     AttributeType,     value    AttributeValue }     AttributeType ::= OBJECT IDENTIFIER     AttributeValue ::= ANY DEFINED BY AttributeType   ....

					Denigrated, use setSubject(X500Principal) or setSubject(byte[]) instead. This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253 String form of some distinguished names. Sets the subject criterion. The specified distinguished name must match the subject distinguished name in the X509Certificate. If null, any subject distinguished name will do. If subjectDN is not null, it should contain a distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

				<name>
					public void setSubject(byte[] subjectDN)                  throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the subject criterion. The specified distinguished name must match the subject distinguished name in the X509Certificate. If null, any subject distinguished name will do. If subjectDN is not null, it should contain a single DER encoded distinguished name, as defined in X.501. For the ASN.1 notation for this structure, see setIssuer(byte [] issuerDN).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setSubjectKeyIdentifier(byte[] subjectKeyID)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the subjectKeyIdentifier criterion. The X509Certificate must contain a SubjectKeyIdentifier extension for which the contents of the extension matches the specified criterion value. If the criterion value is null, no subjectKeyIdentifier check will be done. If subjectKeyID is not null, it should contain a single DER encoded value corresponding to the contents of the extension value (not including the object identifier, criticality setting, and encapsulating OCTET STRING) for a SubjectKeyIdentifier extension. The ASN.1 notation for this structure follows.    SubjectKeyIdentifier ::= KeyIdentifier     KeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING   Since the format of subject key identifiers is not mandated by any standard, subject key identifiers are not parsed by the X509CertSelector. Instead, the values are compared using a byte-by-byte comparison. Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setAuthorityKeyIdentifier(byte[] authorityKeyID)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the authorityKeyIdentifier criterion. The X509Certificate must contain an AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension for which the contents of the extension value matches the specified criterion value. If the criterion value is null, no authorityKeyIdentifier check will be done. If authorityKeyID is not null, it should contain a single DER encoded value corresponding to the contents of the extension value (not including the object identifier, criticality setting, and encapsulating OCTET STRING) for an AuthorityKeyIdentifier extension. The ASN.1 notation for this structure follows.    AuthorityKeyIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {      keyIdentifier             [0] KeyIdentifier           OPTIONAL,      authorityCertIssuer       [1] GeneralNames            OPTIONAL,      authorityCertSerialNumber [2] CertificateSerialNumber OPTIONAL  }     KeyIdentifier ::= OCTET STRING   Authority key identifiers are not parsed by the X509CertSelector. Instead, the values are compared using a byte-by-byte comparison. When the keyIdentifier field of AuthorityKeyIdentifier is populated, the value is usually taken from the SubjectKeyIdentifier extension in the issuer's certificate. Note, however, that the result of X509Certificate.getExtensionValue(<SubjectKeyIdentifier Object Identifier>) on the issuer's certificate may NOT be used directly as the input to setAuthorityKeyIdentifier. This is because the SubjectKeyIdentifier contains only a KeyIdentifier OCTET STRING, and not a SEQUENCE of KeyIdentifier, GeneralNames, and CertificateSerialNumber. In order to use the extension value of the issuer certificate's SubjectKeyIdentifier extension, it will be necessary to extract the value of the embedded KeyIdentifier OCTET STRING, then DER encode this OCTET STRING inside a SEQUENCE. For more details on SubjectKeyIdentifier, see setSubjectKeyIdentifier(byte[] subjectKeyID). Note also that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

				<name>
					public void setCertificateValid(Date certValid)
				</name>

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setSubjectPublicKey(byte[] key)                           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the subjectPublicKey criterion. The X509Certificate must contain the specified subject public key. If null, no subjectPublicKey check will be done. Because this method allows the public key to be specified as a byte array, it may be used for unknown key types. If key is not null, it should contain a single DER encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo structure, as defined in X.509. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is as follows.    SubjectPublicKeyInfo  ::=  SEQUENCE  {     algorithm            AlgorithmIdentifier,     subjectPublicKey     BIT STRING  }     AlgorithmIdentifier  ::=  SEQUENCE  {     algorithm               OBJECT IDENTIFIER,     parameters              ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL  }                                -- contains a value of the type                                -- registered for use with the                                -- algorithm object identifier value   Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

					public void setKeyUsage(boolean[] keyUsage)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the keyUsage criterion. The X509Certificate must allow the specified keyUsage values. If null, no keyUsage check will be done. Note that an X509Certificate that has no keyUsage extension implicitly allows all keyUsage values. Note that the boolean array supplied here is cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

					public void setExtendedKeyUsage(Set<String> keyPurposeSet)                           throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the extendedKeyUsage criterion. The X509Certificate must allow the specified key purposes in its extended key usage extension. If keyPurposeSet is empty or null, no extendedKeyUsage check will be done. Note that an X509Certificate that has no extendedKeyUsage extension implicitly allows all key purposes. Note that the Set is cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setMatchAllSubjectAltNames(boolean matchAllNames)
				</name>
				<description>
					Enables/disables matching all of the subjectAlternativeNames specified in the setSubjectAlternativeNames or addSubjectAlternativeName methods. If enabled, the X509Certificate must contain all of the specified subject alternative names. If disabled, the X509Certificate must contain at least one of the specified subject alternative names. The matchAllNames flag is true by default.
				</description>

					public void setSubjectAlternativeNames(Collection<List<?>> names)                                  throws IOException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The X509Certificate must contain all or at least one of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of the matchAllNames flag (see setMatchAllSubjectAltNames). This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call, the complete set of subject alternative names for the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The specified value replaces the previous value for the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The names parameter (if not null) is a Collection with one entry for each name to be included in the subject alternative name criterion. Each entry is a List whose first entry is an Integer (the name type, 0-8) and whose second entry is a String or a byte array (the name, in string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively). There can be multiple names of the same type. If null is supplied as the value for this argument, no subjectAlternativeNames check will be performed. Each subject alternative name in the Collection may be specified either as a String or as an ASN.1 encoded byte array. For more details about the formats used, see addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, String name) and addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name). Note: for distinguished names, specify the byte array form instead of the String form. See the note in addSubjectAlternativeName(int, String) for more information. Note that the names parameter can contain duplicate names (same name and name type), but they may be removed from the Collection of names returned by the getSubjectAlternativeNames method. Note that a deep copy is performed on the Collection to protect against subsequent modifications.

				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a name to the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The X509Certificate must contain all or at least one of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of the matchAllNames flag (see setMatchAllSubjectAltNames). This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of subject alternative names. The specified name is added to any previous value for the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. If the specified name is a duplicate, it may be ignored. The name is provided in string format. RFC 822, DNS, and URI names use the well-established string formats for those types (subject to the restrictions included in RFC 3280). IPv4 address names are supplied using dotted quad notation. OID address names are represented as a series of nonnegative integers separated by periods. And directory names (distinguished names) are supplied in RFC 2253 format. No standard string format is defined for otherNames, X.400 names, EDI party names, IPv6 address names, or any other type of names. They should be specified using the addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name) method. Note: for distinguished names, use addSubjectAlternativeName(int, byte[]) instead. This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253 String form of some distinguished names.

					Adds a name to the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The X509Certificate must contain all or at least one of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of the matchAllNames flag (see setMatchAllSubjectAltNames). This method allows the caller to add a name to the set of subject alternative names. The specified name is added to any previous value for the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. If the specified name is a duplicate, it may be ignored. The name is provided as a byte array. This byte array should contain the DER encoded name, as it would appear in the GeneralName structure defined in RFC 3280 and X.509. The encoded byte array should only contain the encoded value of the name, and should not include the tag associated with the name in the GeneralName structure. The ASN.1 definition of this structure appears below.     GeneralName ::= CHOICE {         otherName                       [0]     OtherName,         rfc822Name                      [1]     IA5String,         dNSName                         [2]     IA5String,         x400Address                     [3]     ORAddress,         directoryName                   [4]     Name,         ediPartyName                    [5]     EDIPartyName,         uniformResourceIdentifier       [6]     IA5String,         iPAddress                       [7]     OCTET STRING,         registeredID                    [8]     OBJECT IDENTIFIER}   Note that the byte array supplied here is cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

					Sets the name constraints criterion. The X509Certificate must have subject and subject alternative names that meet the specified name constraints. The name constraints are specified as a byte array. This byte array should contain the DER encoded form of the name constraints, as they would appear in the NameConstraints structure defined in RFC 3280 and X.509.

				<description>
					Sets the basic constraints constraint. If the value is greater than or equal to zero, X509Certificates must include a basicConstraints extension with a pathLen of at least this value. If the value is -2, only end-entity certificates are accepted. If the value is -1, no check is done. This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward (from the target toward the trust anchor. If a partial path has been built, any candidate certificate must have a maxPathLen value greater than or equal to the number of certificates in the partial path.

					Sets the pathToNames criterion. The X509Certificate must not include name constraints that would prohibit building a path to the specified names. This method allows the caller to specify, with a single method call, the complete set of names which the X509Certificates's name constraints must permit. The specified value replaces the previous value for the pathToNames criterion. This constraint is useful when building a certification path forward (from the target toward the trust anchor.

This method should not be relied on as it can fail to match some certificates because of a loss of encoding information in the RFC 2253 String form of some distinguished names. Returns the issuer criterion as a String. This distinguished name must match the issuer distinguished name in the X509Certificate. If null, the issuer criterion is disabled and any issuer distinguished name will do. If the value returned is not null, it is a distinguished name, in RFC 2253 format.

				<description>
					Returns the issuer criterion as a byte array. This distinguished name must match the issuer distinguished name in the X509Certificate. If null, the issuer criterion is disabled and any issuer distinguished name will do.

			<method>
				<name>
					public Set<String> getExtendedKeyUsage()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the extendedKeyUsage criterion. The X509Certificate must allow the specified key purposes in its extended key usage extension. If the keyPurposeSet returned is empty or null, no extendedKeyUsage check will be done. Note that an X509Certificate that has no extendedKeyUsage extension implicitly allows all key purposes.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getMatchAllSubjectAltNames()
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates if the X509Certificate must contain all or at least one of the subjectAlternativeNames specified in the setSubjectAlternativeNames or addSubjectAlternativeName methods. If true, the X509Certificate must contain all of the specified subject alternative names. If false, the X509Certificate must contain at least one of the specified subject alternative names.
				</description>

					public Collection<List<?>> getSubjectAlternativeNames()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a copy of the subjectAlternativeNames criterion. The X509Certificate must contain all or at least one of the specified subjectAlternativeNames, depending on the value of the matchAllNames flag (see getMatchAllSubjectAltNames). If the value returned is null, no subjectAlternativeNames check will be performed. If the value returned is not null, it is a Collection with one entry for each name to be included in the subject alternative name criterion. Each entry is a List whose first entry is an Integer (the name type, 0-8) and whose second entry is a String or a byte array (the name, in string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively). There can be multiple names of the same type. Note that the Collection returned may contain duplicate names (same name and name type). Each subject alternative name in the Collection may be specified either as a String or as an ASN.1 encoded byte array. For more details about the formats used, see addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, String name) and addSubjectAlternativeName(int type, byte [] name). Note that a deep copy is performed on the Collection to protect against subsequent modifications.

				<description>
					Returns the name constraints criterion. The X509Certificate must have subject and subject alternative names that meet the specified name constraints. The name constraints are returned as a byte array. This byte array contains the DER encoded form of the name constraints, as they would appear in the NameConstraints structure defined in RFC 3280 and X.509. The ASN.1 notation for this structure is supplied in the documentation for setNameConstraints(byte [] bytes). Note that the byte array returned is cloned to protect against subsequent modifications.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Collection<List<?>> getPathToNames()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a copy of the pathToNames criterion. The X509Certificate must not include name constraints that would prohibit building a path to the specified names. If the value returned is null, no pathToNames check will be performed. If the value returned is not null, it is a Collection with one entry for each name to be included in the pathToNames criterion. Each entry is a List whose first entry is an Integer (the name type, 0-8) and whose second entry is a String or a byte array (the name, in string or ASN.1 DER encoded form, respectively). There can be multiple names of the same type. Note that the Collection returned may contain duplicate names (same name and name type). Each name in the Collection may be specified either as a String or as an ASN.1 encoded byte array. For more details about the formats used, see addPathToName(int type, String name) and addPathToName(int type, byte [] name). Note that a deep copy is performed on the Collection to protect against subsequent modifications.
