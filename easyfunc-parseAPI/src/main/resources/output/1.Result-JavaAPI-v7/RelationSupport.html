		<description>
			A RelationSupport object is used internally by the Relation Service to represent simple relations (only roles, no properties or methods), with an unlimited number of roles, of any relation type. As internal representation, it is not exposed to the user. RelationSupport class conforms to the design patterns of standard MBean. So the user can decide to instantiate a RelationSupport object himself as a MBean (as it follows the MBean design patterns), to register it in the MBean Server, and then to add it in the Relation Service. The user can also, when creating his own MBean relation class, have it extending RelationSupport, to retrieve the implementations of required interfaces (see below). It is also possible to have in a user relation MBean class a member being a RelationSupport object, and to implement the required interfaces by delegating all to this member. RelationSupport implements the Relation interface (to be handled by the Relation Service). It implements also the MBeanRegistration interface to be able to retrieve the MBean Server where it is registered (if registered as a MBean) to access to its Relation Service.

					Creates a RelationSupport object. This constructor has to be used when the RelationSupport object will be registered as a MBean by the user, or when creating a user relation MBean whose class extends RelationSupport. Nothing is done at the Relation Service level, i.e. the RelationSupport object is not added to the RelationService and no checks are performed to see if the provided values are correct. The object is always created, EXCEPT if: - any of the required parameters is null. - the same name is used for two roles. To be handled as a relation, the RelationSupport object has to be added to the Relation Service using the Relation Service method addRelation().

				<description>
					Creates a RelationSupport object. This constructor has to be used when the user relation MBean implements the interfaces expected to be supported by a relation by delegating to a RelationSupport object. This object needs to know the Relation Service expected to handle the relation. So it has to know the MBean Server where the Relation Service is registered. According to a limitation, a relation MBean must be registered in the same MBean Server as the Relation Service expected to handle it. So the user relation MBean has to be created and registered, and then the wrapped RelationSupport object can be created within the identified MBean Server. Nothing is done at the Relation Service level, i.e. the RelationSupport object is not added to the RelationService and no checks are performed to see if the provided values are correct. The object is always created, EXCEPT if: - any of the required parameters is null. - the same name is used for two roles. To be handled as a relation, the RelationSupport object has to be added to the Relation Service using the Relation Service method addRelation().

				<description>
					Callback used by the Relation Service when a MBean referenced in a role is unregistered. The Relation Service will call this method to let the relation take action to reflect the impact of such unregistration. BEWARE. the user is not expected to call this method. Current implementation is to set the role with its current value (list of ObjectNames of referenced MBeans) without the unregistered one.

					Description copied from interface: MBeanRegistration Allows the MBean to perform any operations it needs before being registered in the MBean Server. If the name of the MBean is not specified, the MBean can provide a name for its registration. If any exception is raised, the MBean will not be registered in the MBean Server.

				<name>
					public void postRegister(Boolean registrationDone)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from interface: MBeanRegistration Allows the MBean to perform any operations needed after having been registered in the MBean server or after the registration has failed. If the implementation of this method throws a RuntimeException or an Error, the MBean Server will rethrow those inside a RuntimeMBeanException or RuntimeErrorException, respectively. However, throwing an exception in postRegister will not change the state of the MBean: if the MBean was already registered (registrationDone is true), the MBean will remain registered. This might be confusing for the code calling createMBean() or registerMBean(), as such code might assume that MBean registration has failed when such an exception is raised. Therefore it is recommended that implementations of postRegister do not throw Runtime Exceptions or Errors if it can be avoided.

				<description>
					Description copied from interface: MBeanRegistration Allows the MBean to perform any operations needed after having been unregistered in the MBean server. If the implementation of this method throws a RuntimeException or an Error, the MBean Server will rethrow those inside a RuntimeMBeanException or RuntimeErrorException, respectively. However, throwing an exception in postDeregister will not change the state of the MBean: the MBean was already successfully deregistered and will remain so. This might be confusing for the code calling unregisterMBean(), as it might assume that MBean deregistration has failed. Therefore it is recommended that implementations of postDeregister do not throw Runtime Exceptions or Errors if it can be avoided.

				<description>
					Description copied from interface: RelationSupportMBean Specifies whether this relation is handled by the Relation Service. BEWARE, this method has to be exposed as the Relation Service will access the relation through its management interface. It is RECOMMENDED NOT to use this method. Using it does not affect the registration of the relation object in the Relation Service, but will provide wrong information about it!
