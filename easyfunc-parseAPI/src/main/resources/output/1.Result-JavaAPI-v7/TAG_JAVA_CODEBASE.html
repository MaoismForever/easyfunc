					Class downloading is supported for stubs, ties, values, and value helpers. The specification allows transmission of codebase information on the wire for stubs and ties, and enables usage of pre-existing ClassLoaders when relevant. For values and value helpers, the codebase is transmitted after the value tag. For stubs and ties, the codebase is transmitted as the TaggedComponent TAG_JAVA_CODEBASE in the IOR profile, where the component_data is a CDR encapsulation of the codebase written as an IDL string. The codebase is a space-separated list of one or more URLs.
