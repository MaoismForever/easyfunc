			public static enum SSLEngineResult.Status  extends Enum<SSLEngineResult.Status>
		</name>
		<description>
			An SSLEngineResult enum describing the overall result of the SSLEngine operation. The Status value does not reflect the state of a SSLEngine handshake currently in progress. The SSLEngineResult's HandshakeStatus should be consulted for that information.

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final SSLEngineResult.Status BUFFER_UNDERFLOW
				</name>
				<description>
					The SSLEngine was not able to unwrap the incoming data because there were not enough source bytes available to make a complete packet. Repeat the call once more bytes are available.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final SSLEngineResult.Status BUFFER_OVERFLOW
				</name>
				<description>
					The SSLEngine was not able to process the operation because there are not enough bytes available in the destination buffer to hold the result. Repeat the call once more bytes are available.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final SSLEngineResult.Status OK
				</name>
				<description>
					The SSLEngine completed the operation, and is available to process similar calls.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final SSLEngineResult.Status CLOSED
				</name>
				<description>
					The operation just closed this side of the SSLEngine, or the operation could not be completed because it was already closed.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static SSLEngineResult.Status[] values()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array containing the constants of this enum type, in the order they are declared. This method may be used to iterate over the constants as follows:   for (SSLEngineResult.Status c : SSLEngineResult.Status.values())      System.out.println(c);
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static SSLEngineResult.Status valueOf(String name)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the enum constant of this type with the specified name. The string must match exactly an identifier used to declare an enum constant in this type. (Extraneous whitespace characters are not permitted.)
