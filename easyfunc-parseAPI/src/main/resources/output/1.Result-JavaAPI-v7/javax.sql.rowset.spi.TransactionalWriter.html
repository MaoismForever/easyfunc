		<description>
			A specialized interface that facilitates an extension of the standard SyncProvider abstract class so that it has finer grained transaction control. If one or more disconnected RowSet objects are particating in a global transaction, they may wish to coordinate their synchronization commits to preserve data integrity and reduce the number of sychronization exceptions. If this is the case, an application should set the CachedRowSet constant COMMIT_ON_ACCEPT_CHANGES to false and use the commit and rollback methods defined in this interface to manage transaction boundaries.
