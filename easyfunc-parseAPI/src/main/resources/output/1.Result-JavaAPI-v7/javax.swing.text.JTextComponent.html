		<description>
			JTextComponent is the base class for swing text components. It tries to be compatible with the java.awt.TextComponent class where it can reasonably do so. Also provided are other services for additional flexibility (beyond the pluggable UI and bean support). You can find information on how to use the functionality this class provides in General Rules for Using Text Components, a section in The Java Tutorial. Caret Changes The caret is a pluggable object in swing text components. Notification of changes to the caret position and the selection are sent to implementations of the CaretListener interface that have been registered with the text component. The UI will install a default caret unless a customized caret has been set. By default the caret tracks all the document changes performed on the Event Dispatching Thread and updates it's position accordingly if an insertion occurs before or at the caret position or a removal occurs before the caret position. DefaultCaret tries to make itself visible which may lead to scrolling of a text component within JScrollPane. The default caret behavior can be changed by the DefaultCaret.setUpdatePolicy(int) method. Note: Non-editable text components also have a caret though it may not be painted. Commands Text components provide a number of commands that can be used to manipulate the component. This is essentially the way that the component expresses its capabilities. These are expressed in terms of the swing Action interface, using the TextAction implementation. The set of commands supported by the text component can be found with the getActions() method. These actions can be bound to key events, fired from buttons, etc. Text Input The text components support flexible and internationalized text input, using keymaps and the input method framework, while maintaining compatibility with the AWT listener model. A Keymap lets an application bind key strokes to actions. In order to allow keymaps to be shared across multiple text components, they can use actions that extend TextAction. TextAction can determine which JTextComponent most recently has or had focus and therefore is the subject of the action (In the case that the ActionEvent sent to the action doesn't contain the target text component as its source). The input method framework lets text components interact with input methods, separate software components that preprocess events to let users enter thousands of different characters using keyboards with far fewer keys. JTextComponent is an active client of the framework, so it implements the preferred user interface for interacting with input methods. As a consequence, some key events do not reach the text component because they are handled by an input method, and some text input reaches the text component as committed text within an InputMethodEvent instead of as a key event. The complete text input is the combination of the characters in keyTyped key events and committed text in input method events. The AWT listener model lets applications attach event listeners to components in order to bind events to actions. Swing encourages the use of keymaps instead of listeners, but maintains compatibility with listeners by giving the listeners a chance to steal an event by consuming it. Keyboard event and input method events are handled in the following stages, with each stage capable of consuming the event: Stage KeyEvent InputMethodEvent 1. input methods (generated here) 2. focus manager 3. registered key listeners registered input method listeners 4. input method handling in JTextComponent 5. keymap handling using the current keymap 6. keyboard handling in JComponent (e.g. accelerators, component navigation, etc.) To maintain compatibility with applications that listen to key events but are not aware of input method events, the input method handling in stage 4 provides a compatibility mode for components that do not process input method events. For these components, the committed text is converted to keyTyped key events and processed in the key event pipeline starting at stage 3 instead of in the input method event pipeline. By default the component will create a keymap (named DEFAULT_KEYMAP) that is shared by all JTextComponent instances as the default keymap. Typically a look-and-feel implementation will install a different keymap that resolves to the default keymap for those bindings not found in the different keymap. The minimal bindings include: inserting content into the editor for the printable keys. removing content with the backspace and del keys. caret movement forward and backward Model/View Split The text components have a model-view split. A text component pulls together the objects used to represent the model, view, and controller. The text document model may be shared by other views which act as observers of the model (e.g. a document may be shared by multiple components). The model is defined by the Document interface. This is intended to provide a flexible text storage mechanism that tracks change during edits and can be extended to more sophisticated models. The model interfaces are meant to capture the capabilities of expression given by SGML, a system used to express a wide variety of content. Each modification to the document causes notification of the details of the change to be sent to all observers in the form of a DocumentEvent which allows the views to stay up to date with the model. This event is sent to observers that have implemented the DocumentListener interface and registered interest with the model being observed. Location Information The capability of determining the location of text in the view is provided. There are two methods, modelToView(int) and viewToModel(java.awt.Point) for determining this information. Undo/Redo support Support for an edit history mechanism is provided to allow undo/redo operations. The text component does not itself provide the history buffer by default, but does provide the UndoableEdit records that can be used in conjunction with a history buffer to provide the undo/redo support. The support is provided by the Document model, which allows one to attach UndoableEditListener implementations. Thread Safety The swing text components provide some support of thread safe operations. Because of the high level of configurability of the text components, it is possible to circumvent the protection provided. The protection primarily comes from the model, so the documentation of AbstractDocument describes the assumptions of the protection provided. The methods that are safe to call asynchronously are marked with comments. Newlines For a discussion on how newlines are handled, see DefaultEditorKit. Printing support Several print methods are provided for basic document printing. If more advanced printing is needed, use the getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat) method. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setComponentOrientation(ComponentOrientation o)
				</name>
				<description>
					Description copied from class: Component Sets the language-sensitive orientation that is to be used to order the elements or text within this component. Language-sensitive LayoutManager and Component subclasses will use this property to determine how to lay out and draw components. At construction time, a component's orientation is set to ComponentOrientation.UNKNOWN, indicating that it has not been specified explicitly. The UNKNOWN orientation behaves the same as ComponentOrientation.LEFT_TO_RIGHT. To set the orientation of a single component, use this method. To set the orientation of an entire component hierarchy, use applyComponentOrientation. This method changes layout-related information, and therefore, invalidates the component hierarchy.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setMargin(Insets m)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets margin space between the text component's border and its text. The text component's default Border object will use this value to create the proper margin. However, if a non-default border is set on the text component, it is that Border object's responsibility to create the appropriate margin space (else this property will effectively be ignored). This causes a redraw of the component. A PropertyChange event ("margin") is sent to all listeners.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public NavigationFilter getNavigationFilter()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the NavigationFilter. NavigationFilter is used by DefaultCaret and the default cursor movement actions as a way to restrict the cursor movement. A null return value implies the cursor movement and selection should not be restricted.
				</description>

					public void setHighlighter(Highlighter h)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the highlighter to be used. By default this will be set by the UI that gets installed. This can be changed to a custom highlighter if desired. The highlighter can be set to null to disable it. A PropertyChange event ("highlighter") is fired when a new highlighter is installed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setKeymap(Keymap map)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the keymap to use for binding events to actions. Setting to null effectively disables keyboard input. A PropertyChange event ("keymap") is fired when a new keymap is installed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setDragEnabled(boolean b)
				</name>
				<description>
					Turns on or off automatic drag handling. In order to enable automatic drag handling, this property should be set to true, and the component's TransferHandler needs to be non-null. The default value of the dragEnabled property is false. The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture, lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the component's TextUI. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and feels (including those that subclass BasicLookAndFeel) begin a drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over a selection and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to true can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave. If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still begin a drag and drop operation by calling exportAsDrag on the component's TransferHandler.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean getDragEnabled()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether or not automatic drag handling is enabled.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final void setDropMode(DropMode dropMode)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the drop mode for this component. For backward compatibility, the default for this property is DropMode.USE_SELECTION. Usage of DropMode.INSERT is recommended, however, for an improved user experience. It offers similar behavior of dropping between text locations, but does so without affecting the actual text selection and caret location. JTextComponents support the following drop modes: DropMode.USE_SELECTION DropMode.INSERT The drop mode is only meaningful if this component has a TransferHandler that accepts drops.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final DropMode getDropMode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the drop mode for this component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final JTextComponent.DropLocation getDropLocation()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the location that this component should visually indicate as the drop location during a DnD operation over the component, or null if no location is to currently be shown. This method is not meant for querying the drop location from a TransferHandler, as the drop location is only set after the TransferHandler's canImport has returned and has allowed for the location to be shown. When this property changes, a property change event with name "dropLocation" is fired by the component.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Keymap getKeymap()
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches the keymap currently active in this text component.

					public static Keymap addKeymap(String nm,                 Keymap parent)
				</name>
				<description>
					Adds a new keymap into the keymap hierarchy. Keymap bindings resolve from bottom up so an attribute specified in a child will override an attribute specified in the parent.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static Keymap removeKeymap(String nm)
				</name>
				<description>
					Removes a named keymap previously added to the document. Keymaps with null names may not be removed in this way.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static Keymap getKeymap(String nm)
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches a named keymap previously added to the document. This does not work with null-named keymaps.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static void loadKeymap(Keymap map,                JTextComponent.KeyBinding[] bindings,                Action[] actions)
				</name>
				<description>
					Loads a keymap with a bunch of bindings. This can be used to take a static table of definitions and load them into some keymap. The following example illustrates an example of binding some keys to the cut, copy, and paste actions associated with a JTextComponent. A code fragment to accomplish this might look as follows:        static final JTextComponent.KeyBinding[] defaultBindings = {       new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(         KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_C, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),         DefaultEditorKit.copyAction),       new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(         KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_V, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),         DefaultEditorKit.pasteAction),       new JTextComponent.KeyBinding(         KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_X, InputEvent.CTRL_MASK),         DefaultEditorKit.cutAction),     };       JTextComponent c = new JTextPane();     Keymap k = c.getKeymap();     JTextComponent.loadKeymap(k, defaultBindings, c.getActions());     The sets of bindings and actions may be empty but must be non-null.

					Sets the selection end to the specified position. The new end point is constrained to be at or after the current selection start. This is available for backward compatibility to code that called this method on java.awt.TextComponent. This is implemented to forward to the Caret implementation which is where the actual selection is maintained.

				<name>
					public void select(int selectionStart,            int selectionEnd)
				</name>
				<description>
					Selects the text between the specified start and end positions. This method sets the start and end positions of the selected text, enforcing the restriction that the start position must be greater than or equal to zero. The end position must be greater than or equal to the start position, and less than or equal to the length of the text component's text. If the caller supplies values that are inconsistent or out of bounds, the method enforces these constraints silently, and without failure. Specifically, if the start position or end position is greater than the length of the text, it is reset to equal the text length. If the start position is less than zero, it is reset to zero, and if the end position is less than the start position, it is reset to the start position. This call is provided for backward compatibility. It is routed to a call to setCaretPosition followed by a call to moveCaretPosition. The preferred way to manage selection is by calling those methods directly.

				<description>
					Returns the string to be used as the tooltip for event. This will return one of: If setToolTipText has been invoked with a non-null value, it will be returned, otherwise The value from invoking getToolTipText on the UI will be returned. By default JTextComponent does not register itself with the ToolTipManager. This means that tooltips will NOT be shown from the TextUI unless registerComponent has been invoked on the ToolTipManager.

				</name>
				<description>
					Components that display logical rows or columns should compute the scroll increment that will completely expose one new row or column, depending on the value of orientation. Ideally, components should handle a partially exposed row or column by returning the distance required to completely expose the item. The default implementation of this is to simply return 10% of the visible area. Subclasses are likely to be able to provide a much more reasonable value.

				<name>
					public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportWidth()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if a viewport should always force the width of this Scrollable to match the width of the viewport. For example a normal text view that supported line wrapping would return true here, since it would be undesirable for wrapped lines to disappear beyond the right edge of the viewport. Note that returning true for a Scrollable whose ancestor is a JScrollPane effectively disables horizontal scrolling. Scrolling containers, like JViewport, will use this method each time they are validated.

					public boolean getScrollableTracksViewportHeight()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if a viewport should always force the height of this Scrollable to match the height of the viewport. For example a columnar text view that flowed text in left to right columns could effectively disable vertical scrolling by returning true here. Scrolling containers, like JViewport, will use this method each time they are validated.

				</name>
				<description>
					Prints the content of this JTextComponent. Note: this method blocks until printing is done. Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing MessageFormat arguments. The printing code requests Strings from the formats, providing a single item which may be included in the formatted string: an Integer representing the current page number. showPrintDialog boolean parameter allows you to specify whether a print dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user may use the dialog to change printing attributes or even cancel the print. service allows you to provide the initial PrintService for the print dialog, or to specify PrintService to print to when the dialog is not shown. attributes can be used to provide the initial values for the print dialog, or to supply any needed attributes when the dialog is not shown. attributes can be used to control how the job will print, for example duplex or single-sided. interactive boolean parameter allows you to specify whether to perform printing in interactive mode. If true, a progress dialog, with an abort option, is displayed for the duration of printing. This dialog is modal when print is invoked on the Event Dispatch Thread and non-modal otherwise. Warning: calling this method on the Event Dispatch Thread with interactive false blocks all events, including repaints, from being processed until printing is complete. It is only recommended when printing from an application with no visible GUI. Note: In headless mode, showPrintDialog and interactive parameters are ignored and no dialogs are shown. This method ensures the document is not mutated during printing. To indicate it visually, setEnabled(false) is set for the duration of printing. This method uses getPrintable(java.text.MessageFormat, java.text.MessageFormat) to render document content. This method is thread-safe, although most Swing methods are not. Please see How to Use Threads for more information. Sample Usage. This code snippet shows a cross-platform print dialog and then prints the JTextComponent in interactive mode unless the user cancels the dialog:    textComponent.print(new MessageFormat("My text component header"),       new MessageFormat("Footer. Page - {0}"), true, null, null, true);   Executing this code off the Event Dispatch Thread performs printing on the background. The following pattern might be used for background printing:        FutureTask<Boolean> future =           new FutureTask<Boolean>(               new Callable<Boolean>() {                   public Boolean call() {                       return textComponent.print(.....);                   }               });       executor.execute(future);

					public Printable getPrintable(MessageFormat headerFormat,                       MessageFormat footerFormat)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a Printable to use for printing the content of this JTextComponent. The returned Printable prints the document as it looks on the screen except being reformatted to fit the paper. The returned Printable can be wrapped inside another Printable in order to create complex reports and documents. The returned Printable shares the document with this JTextComponent. It is the responsibility of the developer to ensure that the document is not mutated while this Printable is used. Printing behavior is undefined when the document is mutated during printing. Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing MessageFormat arguments. The printing code requests Strings from the formats, providing a single item which may be included in the formatted string: an Integer representing the current page number. The returned Printable when printed, formats the document content appropriately for the page size. For correct line wrapping the imageable width of all pages must be the same. See PageFormat.getImageableWidth(). This method is thread-safe, although most Swing methods are not. Please see How to Use Threads for more information. The returned Printable can be printed on any thread. This implementation returned Printable performs all painting on the Event Dispatch Thread, regardless of what thread it is used on.
