		<description>
			Immutable, arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. A BigDecimal consists of an arbitrary precision integer unscaled value and a 32-bit integer scale. If zero or positive, the scale is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. If negative, the unscaled value of the number is multiplied by ten to the power of the negation of the scale. The value of the number represented by the BigDecimal is therefore (unscaledValue × 10-scale). The BigDecimal class provides operations for arithmetic, scale manipulation, rounding, comparison, hashing, and format conversion. The toString() method provides a canonical representation of a BigDecimal. The BigDecimal class gives its user complete control over rounding behavior. If no rounding mode is specified and the exact result cannot be represented, an exception is thrown; otherwise, calculations can be carried out to a chosen precision and rounding mode by supplying an appropriate MathContext object to the operation. In either case, eight rounding modes are provided for the control of rounding. Using the integer fields in this class (such as ROUND_HALF_UP) to represent rounding mode is largely obsolete; the enumeration values of the RoundingMode enum, (such as RoundingMode.HALF_UP) should be used instead. When a MathContext object is supplied with a precision setting of 0 (for example, MathContext.UNLIMITED), arithmetic operations are exact, as are the arithmetic methods which take no MathContext object. (This is the only behavior that was supported in releases prior to 5.) As a corollary of computing the exact result, the rounding mode setting of a MathContext object with a precision setting of 0 is not used and thus irrelevant. In the case of divide, the exact quotient could have an infinitely long decimal expansion; for example, 1 divided by 3. If the quotient has a nonterminating decimal expansion and the operation is specified to return an exact result, an ArithmeticException is thrown. Otherwise, the exact result of the division is returned, as done for other operations. When the precision setting is not 0, the rules of BigDecimal arithmetic are broadly compatible with selected modes of operation of the arithmetic defined in ANSI X3.274-1996 and ANSI X3.274-1996/AM 1-2000 (section 7.4). Unlike those standards, BigDecimal includes many rounding modes, which were mandatory for division in BigDecimal releases prior to 5. Any conflicts between these ANSI standards and the BigDecimal specification are resolved in favor of BigDecimal. Since the same numerical value can have different representations (with different scales), the rules of arithmetic and rounding must specify both the numerical result and the scale used in the result's representation. In general the rounding modes and precision setting determine how operations return results with a limited number of digits when the exact result has more digits (perhaps infinitely many in the case of division) than the number of digits returned. First, the total number of digits to return is specified by the MathContext's precision setting; this determines the result's precision. The digit count starts from the leftmost nonzero digit of the exact result. The rounding mode determines how any discarded trailing digits affect the returned result. For all arithmetic operators , the operation is carried out as though an exact intermediate result were first calculated and then rounded to the number of digits specified by the precision setting (if necessary), using the selected rounding mode. If the exact result is not returned, some digit positions of the exact result are discarded. When rounding increases the magnitude of the returned result, it is possible for a new digit position to be created by a carry propagating to a leading "9" digit. For example, rounding the value 999.9 to three digits rounding up would be numerically equal to one thousand, represented as 100×101. In such cases, the new "1" is the leading digit position of the returned result. Besides a logical exact result, each arithmetic operation has a preferred scale for representing a result. The preferred scale for each operation is listed in the table below. Preferred Scales for Results of Arithmetic Operations Operation Preferred Scale of Result Add max(addend.scale(), augend.scale()) Subtract max(minuend.scale(), subtrahend.scale()) Multiply multiplier.scale() + multiplicand.scale() Divide dividend.scale() - divisor.scale() These scales are the ones used by the methods which return exact arithmetic results; except that an exact divide may have to use a larger scale since the exact result may have more digits. For example, 1/32 is 0.03125. Before rounding, the scale of the logical exact intermediate result is the preferred scale for that operation. If the exact numerical result cannot be represented in precision digits, rounding selects the set of digits to return and the scale of the result is reduced from the scale of the intermediate result to the least scale which can represent the precision digits actually returned. If the exact result can be represented with at most precision digits, the representation of the result with the scale closest to the preferred scale is returned. In particular, an exactly representable quotient may be represented in fewer than precision digits by removing trailing zeros and decreasing the scale. For example, rounding to three digits using the floor rounding mode, 19/100 = 0.19 // integer=19, scale=2 but 21/110 = 0.190 // integer=190, scale=3 Note that for add, subtract, and multiply, the reduction in scale will equal the number of digit positions of the exact result which are discarded. If the rounding causes a carry propagation to create a new high-order digit position, an additional digit of the result is discarded than when no new digit position is created. Other methods may have slightly different rounding semantics. For example, the result of the pow method using the specified algorithm can occasionally differ from the rounded mathematical result by more than one unit in the last place, one ulp. Two types of operations are provided for manipulating the scale of a BigDecimal: scaling/rounding operations and decimal point motion operations. Scaling/rounding operations (setScale and round) return a BigDecimal whose value is approximately (or exactly) equal to that of the operand, but whose scale or precision is the specified value; that is, they increase or decrease the precision of the stored number with minimal effect on its value. Decimal point motion operations (movePointLeft and movePointRight) return a BigDecimal created from the operand by moving the decimal point a specified distance in the specified direction. For the sake of brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used throughout the descriptions of BigDecimal methods. The pseudo-code expression (i + j) is shorthand for "a BigDecimal whose value is that of the BigDecimal i added to that of the BigDecimal j." The pseudo-code expression (i == j) is shorthand for "true if and only if the BigDecimal i represents the same value as the BigDecimal j." Other pseudo-code expressions are interpreted similarly. Square brackets are used to represent the particular BigInteger and scale pair defining a BigDecimal value; for example [19, 2] is the BigDecimal numerically equal to 0.19 having a scale of 2. Note: care should be exercised if BigDecimal objects are used as keys in a SortedMap or elements in a SortedSet since BigDecimal's natural ordering is inconsistent with equals. See Comparable, SortedMap or SortedSet for more information. All methods and constructors for this class throw NullPointerException when passed a null object reference for any input parameter.

			<method>
				<name>
					public BigDecimal(String val)
				</name>
				<description>
					Translates the string representation of a BigDecimal into a BigDecimal. The string representation consists of an optional sign, '+' ( '\u002B') or '-' ('\u002D'), followed by a sequence of zero or more decimal digits ("the integer"), optionally followed by a fraction, optionally followed by an exponent. The fraction consists of a decimal point followed by zero or more decimal digits. The string must contain at least one digit in either the integer or the fraction. The number formed by the sign, the integer and the fraction is referred to as the significand. The exponent consists of the character 'e' ('\u0065') or 'E' ('\u0045') followed by one or more decimal digits. The value of the exponent must lie between -Integer.MAX_VALUE (Integer.MIN_VALUE+1) and Integer.MAX_VALUE, inclusive. More formally, the strings this constructor accepts are described by the following grammar: BigDecimalString: Signopt Significand Exponentopt Sign: + - Significand: IntegerPart . FractionPartopt . FractionPart IntegerPart IntegerPart: Digits FractionPart: Digits Exponent: ExponentIndicator SignedInteger ExponentIndicator: e E SignedInteger: Signopt Digits Digits: Digit Digits Digit Digit: any character for which Character.isDigit(char) returns true, including 0, 1, 2 ... The scale of the returned BigDecimal will be the number of digits in the fraction, or zero if the string contains no decimal point, subject to adjustment for any exponent; if the string contains an exponent, the exponent is subtracted from the scale. The value of the resulting scale must lie between Integer.MIN_VALUE and Integer.MAX_VALUE, inclusive. The character-to-digit mapping is provided by Character.digit(char, int) set to convert to radix 10. The String may not contain any extraneous characters (whitespace, for example). Examples: The value of the returned BigDecimal is equal to significand × 10 exponent. For each string on the left, the resulting representation [BigInteger, scale] is shown on the right.    "0"            [0,0]   "0.00"         [0,2]   "123"          [123,0]   "-123"         [-123,0]   "1.23E3"       [123,-1]   "1.23E+3"      [123,-1]   "12.3E+7"      [123,-6]   "12.0"         [120,1]   "12.3"         [123,1]   "0.00123"      [123,5]   "-1.23E-12"    [-123,14]   "1234.5E-4"    [12345,5]   "0E+7"         [0,-7]   "-0"           [0,0]   Note: For values other than float and double NaN and ±Infinity, this constructor is compatible with the values returned by Float.toString(float) and Double.toString(double). This is generally the preferred way to convert a float or double into a BigDecimal, as it doesn't suffer from the unpredictability of the BigDecimal(double) constructor.

					public BigDecimal(String val,            MathContext mc)

				<description>
					Translates the string representation of a BigDecimal into a BigDecimal, accepting the same strings as the BigDecimal(String) constructor, with rounding according to the context settings.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public BigDecimal(double val)
				</name>
				<description>
					Translates a double into a BigDecimal which is the exact decimal representation of the double's binary floating-point value. The scale of the returned BigDecimal is the smallest value such that (10scale × val) is an integer. Notes: The results of this constructor can be somewhat unpredictable. One might assume that writing new BigDecimal(0.1) in Java creates a BigDecimal which is exactly equal to 0.1 (an unscaled value of 1, with a scale of 1), but it is actually equal to 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. This is because 0.1 cannot be represented exactly as a double (or, for that matter, as a binary fraction of any finite length). Thus, the value that is being passed in to the constructor is not exactly equal to 0.1, appearances notwithstanding. The String constructor, on the other hand, is perfectly predictable: writing new BigDecimal("0.1") creates a BigDecimal which is exactly equal to 0.1, as one would expect. Therefore, it is generally recommended that the String constructor be used in preference to this one. When a double must be used as a source for a BigDecimal, note that this constructor provides an exact conversion; it does not give the same result as converting the double to a String using the Double.toString(double) method and then using the BigDecimal(String) constructor. To get that result, use the static valueOf(double) method.

				<description>
					Returns a BigDecimal whose value is (thisn), The power is computed exactly, to unlimited precision. The parameter n must be in the range 0 through 999999999, inclusive. ZERO.pow(0) returns ONE. Note that future releases may expand the allowable exponent range of this method.

					public BigDecimal pow(int n,               MathContext mc)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a BigDecimal whose value is (thisn). The current implementation uses the core algorithm defined in ANSI standard X3.274-1996 with rounding according to the context settings. In general, the returned numerical value is within two ulps of the exact numerical value for the chosen precision. Note that future releases may use a different algorithm with a decreased allowable error bound and increased allowable exponent range. The X3.274-1996 algorithm is: An ArithmeticException exception is thrown if abs(n) > 999999999 mc.precision == 0 and n < 0 mc.precision > 0 and n has more than mc.precision decimal digits if n is zero, ONE is returned even if this is zero, otherwise if n is positive, the result is calculated via the repeated squaring technique into a single accumulator. The individual multiplications with the accumulator use the same math context settings as in mc except for a precision increased to mc.precision + elength + 1 where elength is the number of decimal digits in n. if n is negative, the result is calculated as if n were positive; this value is then divided into one using the working precision specified above. The final value from either the positive or negative case is then rounded to the destination precision.

					public BigDecimal setScale(int newScale,                    RoundingMode roundingMode)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a BigDecimal whose scale is the specified value, and whose unscaled value is determined by multiplying or dividing this BigDecimal's unscaled value by the appropriate power of ten to maintain its overall value. If the scale is reduced by the operation, the unscaled value must be divided (rather than multiplied), and the value may be changed; in this case, the specified rounding mode is applied to the division. Note that since BigDecimal objects are immutable, calls of this method do not result in the original object being modified, contrary to the usual convention of having methods named setX mutate field X. Instead, setScale returns an object with the proper scale; the returned object may or may not be newly allocated.

				<name>
					public BigDecimal setScale(int newScale)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a BigDecimal whose scale is the specified value, and whose value is numerically equal to this BigDecimal's. Throws an ArithmeticException if this is not possible. This call is typically used to increase the scale, in which case it is guaranteed that there exists a BigDecimal of the specified scale and the correct value. The call can also be used to reduce the scale if the caller knows that the BigDecimal has sufficiently many zeros at the end of its fractional part (i.e., factors of ten in its integer value) to allow for the rescaling without changing its value. This method returns the same result as the two-argument versions of setScale, but saves the caller the trouble of specifying a rounding mode in cases where it is irrelevant. Note that since BigDecimal objects are immutable, calls of this method do not result in the original object being modified, contrary to the usual convention of having methods named setX mutate field X. Instead, setScale returns an object with the proper scale; the returned object may or may not be newly allocated.

					public int compareTo(BigDecimal val)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares this BigDecimal with the specified BigDecimal. Two BigDecimal objects that are equal in value but have a different scale (like 2.0 and 2.00) are considered equal by this method. This method is provided in preference to individual methods for each of the six boolean comparison operators (<, ==, >, >=, !=, <=). The suggested idiom for performing these comparisons is: (x.compareTo(y) <op> 0), where <op> is one of the six comparison operators.

			<method>
				<name>
					public String toString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the string representation of this BigDecimal, using scientific notation if an exponent is needed. A standard canonical string form of the BigDecimal is created as though by the following steps: first, the absolute value of the unscaled value of the BigDecimal is converted to a string in base ten using the characters '0' through '9' with no leading zeros (except if its value is zero, in which case a single '0' character is used). Next, an adjusted exponent is calculated; this is the negated scale, plus the number of characters in the converted unscaled value, less one. That is, -scale+(ulength-1), where ulength is the length of the absolute value of the unscaled value in decimal digits (its precision). If the scale is greater than or equal to zero and the adjusted exponent is greater than or equal to -6, the number will be converted to a character form without using exponential notation. In this case, if the scale is zero then no decimal point is added and if the scale is positive a decimal point will be inserted with the scale specifying the number of characters to the right of the decimal point. '0' characters are added to the left of the converted unscaled value as necessary. If no character precedes the decimal point after this insertion then a conventional '0' character is prefixed. Otherwise (that is, if the scale is negative, or the adjusted exponent is less than -6), the number will be converted to a character form using exponential notation. In this case, if the converted BigInteger has more than one digit a decimal point is inserted after the first digit. An exponent in character form is then suffixed to the converted unscaled value (perhaps with inserted decimal point); this comprises the letter 'E' followed immediately by the adjusted exponent converted to a character form. The latter is in base ten, using the characters '0' through '9' with no leading zeros, and is always prefixed by a sign character '-' ('\u002D') if the adjusted exponent is negative, '+' ('\u002B') otherwise). Finally, the entire string is prefixed by a minus sign character '-' ('\u002D') if the unscaled value is less than zero. No sign character is prefixed if the unscaled value is zero or positive. Examples: For each representation [unscaled value, scale] on the left, the resulting string is shown on the right.    [123,0]      "123"   [-123,0]     "-123"   [123,-1]     "1.23E+3"   [123,-3]     "1.23E+5"   [123,1]      "12.3"   [123,5]      "0.00123"   [123,10]     "1.23E-8"   [-123,12]    "-1.23E-10"   Notes: There is a one-to-one mapping between the distinguishable BigDecimal values and the result of this conversion. That is, every distinguishable BigDecimal value (unscaled value and scale) has a unique string representation as a result of using toString. If that string representation is converted back to a BigDecimal using the BigDecimal(String) constructor, then the original value will be recovered. The string produced for a given number is always the same; it is not affected by locale. This means that it can be used as a canonical string representation for exchanging decimal data, or as a key for a Hashtable, etc. Locale-sensitive number formatting and parsing is handled by the NumberFormat class and its subclasses. The toEngineeringString() method may be used for presenting numbers with exponents in engineering notation, and the setScale method may be used for rounding a BigDecimal so it has a known number of digits after the decimal point. The digit-to-character mapping provided by Character.forDigit is used.

			<method>
				<name>
					public String toEngineeringString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this BigDecimal, using engineering notation if an exponent is needed. Returns a string that represents the BigDecimal as described in the toString() method, except that if exponential notation is used, the power of ten is adjusted to be a multiple of three (engineering notation) such that the integer part of nonzero values will be in the range 1 through 999. If exponential notation is used for zero values, a decimal point and one or two fractional zero digits are used so that the scale of the zero value is preserved. Note that unlike the output of toString(), the output of this method is not guaranteed to recover the same [integer, scale] pair of this BigDecimal if the output string is converting back to a BigDecimal using the string constructor. The result of this method meets the weaker constraint of always producing a numerically equal result from applying the string constructor to the method's output.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public String toPlainString()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns a string representation of this BigDecimal without an exponent field. For values with a positive scale, the number of digits to the right of the decimal point is used to indicate scale. For values with a zero or negative scale, the resulting string is generated as if the value were converted to a numerically equal value with zero scale and as if all the trailing zeros of the zero scale value were present in the result. The entire string is prefixed by a minus sign character '-' ('\u002D') if the unscaled value is less than zero. No sign character is prefixed if the unscaled value is zero or positive. Note that if the result of this method is passed to the string constructor, only the numerical value of this BigDecimal will necessarily be recovered; the representation of the new BigDecimal may have a different scale. In particular, if this BigDecimal has a negative scale, the string resulting from this method will have a scale of zero when processed by the string constructor. (This method behaves analogously to the toString method in 1.4 and earlier releases.)
