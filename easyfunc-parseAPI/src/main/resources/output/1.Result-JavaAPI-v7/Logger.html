		<description>
			A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to create "anonymous" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. It is important to note that the Logger returned by one of the getLogger factory methods may be garbage collected at any time if a strong reference to the Logger is not kept. Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. Each Logger keeps track of a "parent" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. Each Logger has a "Level" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its level will inherit its effective level from its parent. On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g., SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, recursively up the tree. Each Logger may have a ResourceBundle name associated with it. The named bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own ResourceBundle name, then it will inherit the ResourceBundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. Most of the logger output methods take a "msg" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a localization ResourceBundle and if the ResourceBundle has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string "{0} {1}" would format two parameters as strings. When mapping ResourceBundle names to ResourceBundles, the Logger will first try to use the Thread's ContextClassLoader. If that is null it will try the SystemClassLoader instead. As a temporary transition feature in the initial implementation, if the Logger is unable to locate a ResourceBundle from the ContextClassLoader or SystemClassLoader the Logger will also search up the class stack and use successive calling ClassLoaders to try to locate a ResourceBundle. (This call stack search is to allow containers to transition to using ContextClassLoaders and is likely to be removed in future versions.) Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: There are a set of "log" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. There are a set of "logp" methods (for "log precise") that are like the "log" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. There are a set of "logrb" method (for "log with resource bundle") that are like the "logp" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle name for use in localizing the log message. There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the "entering" methods), method returns (the "exiting" methods) and throwing exceptions (the "throwing" methods). Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are named after the standard Level names ("severe", "warning", "info", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a "best effort" to determine which class and method called into the logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger (unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such as "isLoggable" and "log(LogRecord)" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method.

					@Deprecated  public static final Logger global

				<description>
					Deprecated. Initialization of this field is prone to deadlocks. The field must be initialized by the Logger class initialization which may cause deadlocks with the LogManager class initialization. In such cases two class initialization wait for each other to complete. The preferred way to get the global logger object is via the call Logger.getGlobal(). For compatibility with old JDK versions where the Logger.getGlobal() is not available use the call Logger.getLogger(Logger.GLOBAL_LOGGER_NAME) or Logger.getLogger("global"). The "global" Logger object is provided as a convenience to developers who are making casual use of the Logging package. Developers who are making serious use of the logging package (for example in products) should create and use their own Logger objects, with appropriate names, so that logging can be controlled on a suitable per-Logger granularity. Developers also need to keep a strong reference to their Logger objects to prevent them from being garbage collected.

					public static Logger getLogger(String name)
				</name>
				<description>
					Find or create a logger for a named subsystem. If a logger has already been created with the given name it is returned. Otherwise a new logger is created. If a new logger is created its log level will be configured based on the LogManager configuration and it will configured to also send logging output to its parent's Handlers. It will be registered in the LogManager global namespace. Note: The LogManager may only retain a weak reference to the newly created Logger. It is important to understand that a previously created Logger with the given name may be garbage collected at any time if there is no strong reference to the Logger. In particular, this means that two back-to-back calls like getLogger("MyLogger").log(...) may use different Logger objects named "MyLogger" if there is no strong reference to the Logger named "MyLogger" elsewhere in the program.

					public static Logger getAnonymousLogger()
				</name>
				<description>
					Create an anonymous Logger. The newly created Logger is not registered in the LogManager namespace. There will be no access checks on updates to the logger. This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets. Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private by the creating class. This removes the need for normal security checks, which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update the control state of the Logger. For example an applet can do a setLevel or an addHandler on an anonymous Logger. Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured to have the root logger ("") as its parent. This means that by default it inherits its effective level and handlers from the root logger.
