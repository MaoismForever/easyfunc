		</name>
		<description>
			Class AccessibleRelation describes a relation between the object that implements the AccessibleRelation and one or more other objects. The actual relations that an object has with other objects are defined as an AccessibleRelationSet, which is a composed set of AccessibleRelations. The toDisplayString method allows you to obtain the localized string for a locale independent key from a predefined ResourceBundle for the keys defined in this class. The constants in this class present a strongly typed enumeration of common object roles. If the constants in this class are not sufficient to describe the role of an object, a subclass should be generated from this class and it should provide constants in a similar manner.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String LABEL_FOR
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates an object is a label for one or more target objects.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String LABELED_BY
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates an object is labeled by one or more target objects.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String MEMBER_OF
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates an object is a member of a group of one or more target objects.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String CONTROLLER_FOR
				</name>

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String CONTROLLED_BY
				</name>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public static final String FLOWS_TO
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates an object is logically contiguous with a second object where the second object occurs after the object. An example is a paragraph of text that runs to the end of a page and continues on the next page with an intervening text footer and/or text header. The two parts of the paragraph are separate text elements but are related in that the second element is a continuation of the first element. In other words, the first element "flows to" the second element.
