			public interface Group  extends Principal
		</name>
		<description>
			This interface is used to represent a group of principals. (A principal represents an entity such as an individual user or a company). Note that Group extends Principal. Thus, either a Principal or a Group can be passed as an argument to methods containing a Principal parameter. For example, you can add either a Principal or a Group to a Group object by calling the object's addMember method, passing it the Principal or Group.
