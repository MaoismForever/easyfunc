			public class ShortLookupTable  extends LookupTable
		</name>
		<description>
			This class defines a lookup table object. The output of a lookup operation using an object of this class is interpreted as an unsigned short quantity. The lookup table contains short data arrays for one or more bands (or components) of an image, and it contains an offset which will be subtracted from the input values before indexing the arrays. This allows an array smaller than the native data size to be provided for a constrained input. If there is only one array in the lookup table, it will be applied to all bands.

			<method>
				<name>
					public ShortLookupTable(int offset,                  short[][] data)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a ShortLookupTable object from an array of short arrays representing a lookup table for each band. The offset will be subtracted from the input values before indexing into the arrays. The number of bands is the length of the data argument. The data array for each band is stored as a reference.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final short[][] getTable()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the lookup table data by reference. If this ShortLookupTable was constructed using a single short array, the length of the returned array is one.

			<method>
				<name>
					public int[] lookupPixel(int[] src,                  int[] dst)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array of samples of a pixel, translated with the lookup table. The source and destination array can be the same array. Array dst is returned.
