		<description>
			The DOMImplementation interface provides a number of methods for performing operations that are independent of any particular instance of the document object model. See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification.

					boolean hasFeature(String feature,                   String version)

				<description>
					Test if the DOM implementation implements a specific feature and version, as specified in DOM Features.

					DocumentType createDocumentType(String qualifiedName,                                String publicId,                                String systemId)                                  throws DOMException

				<description>
					Creates an empty DocumentType node. Entity declarations and notations are not made available. Entity reference expansions and default attribute additions do not occur..

					Document createDocument(String namespaceURI,                        String qualifiedName,                        DocumentType doctype)                          throws DOMException
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a DOM Document object of the specified type with its document element. Note that based on the DocumentType given to create the document, the implementation may instantiate specialized Document objects that support additional features than the "Core", such as "HTML" [DOM Level 2 HTML] . On the other hand, setting the DocumentType after the document was created makes this very unlikely to happen. Alternatively, specialized Document creation methods, such as createHTMLDocument [DOM Level 2 HTML] , can be used to obtain specific types of Document objects.

			<method>
				<name>
					Object getFeature(String feature,                  String version)
				</name>
				<description>
					This method returns a specialized object which implements the specialized APIs of the specified feature and version, as specified in DOM Features. The specialized object may also be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods but is not necessarily expected to, as discussed in . This method also allow the implementation to provide specialized objects which do not support the DOMImplementation interface.
