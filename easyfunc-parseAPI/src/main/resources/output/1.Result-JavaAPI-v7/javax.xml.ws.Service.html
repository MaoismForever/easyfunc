			Service objects provide the client view of a Web service. Service acts as a factory of the following: Proxies for a target service endpoint. Instances of Dispatch for dynamic message-oriented invocation of a remote operation. The ports available on a service can be enumerated using the getPorts method. Alternatively, you can pass a service endpoint interface to the unary getPort method and let the runtime select a compatible port. Handler chains for all the objects created by a Service can be set by means of a HandlerResolver. An Executor may be set on the service in order to gain better control over the threads used to dispatch asynchronous callbacks. For instance, thread pooling with certain parameters can be enabled by creating a ThreadPoolExecutor and registering it with the service.

					The getPort method returns a proxy. The parameter serviceEndpointInterface specifies the service endpoint interface that is supported by the returned proxy. In the implementation of this method, the JAX-WS runtime system takes the responsibility of selecting a protocol binding (and a port) and configuring the proxy accordingly. The returned proxy should not be reconfigured by the client.

				</name>
				<description>
					The getPort method returns a proxy. The parameter endpointReference specifies the endpoint that will be invoked by the returned proxy. If there are any reference parameters in the endpointReference, then those reference parameters MUST appear as SOAP headers, indicating them to be reference parameters, on all messages sent to the endpoint. The endpointReference's address MUST be used for invocations on the endpoint. The parameter serviceEndpointInterface specifies the service endpoint interface that is supported by the returned proxy. In the implementation of this method, the JAX-WS runtime system takes the responsibility of selecting a protocol binding (and a port) and configuring the proxy accordingly from the WSDL associated with this Service instance or from the metadata from the endpointReference. If this Service instance has a WSDL and the endpointReference metadata also has a WSDL, then the WSDL from this instance MUST be used. If this Service instance does not have a WSDL and the endpointReference does have a WSDL, then the WSDL from the endpointReference MAY be used. The returned proxy should not be reconfigured by the client. If this Service instance has a known proxy port that matches the information contained in the WSDL, then that proxy is returned, otherwise a WebServiceException is thrown. Calling this method has the same behavior as the following    port = service.getPort(portName, serviceEndpointInterface);   where the portName is retrieved from the metadata of the endpointReference or from the serviceEndpointInterface and the WSDL associated with this Service instance.
