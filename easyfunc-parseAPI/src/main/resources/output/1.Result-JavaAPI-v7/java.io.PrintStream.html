			public class PrintStream  extends FilterOutputStream  implements Appendable, Closeable
		</name>
		<description>
			A PrintStream adds functionality to another output stream, namely the ability to print representations of various data values conveniently. Two other features are provided as well. Unlike other output streams, a PrintStream never throws an IOException; instead, exceptional situations merely set an internal flag that can be tested via the checkError method. Optionally, a PrintStream can be created so as to flush automatically; this means that the flush method is automatically invoked after a byte array is written, one of the println methods is invoked, or a newline character or byte ('\n') is written. All characters printed by a PrintStream are converted into bytes using the platform's default character encoding. The PrintWriter class should be used in situations that require writing characters rather than bytes.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void flush()
				</name>
				<description>
					Flushes the stream. This is done by writing any buffered output bytes to the underlying output stream and then flushing that stream.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void close()
				</name>
				<description>
					Closes the stream. This is done by flushing the stream and then closing the underlying output stream.

				</name>
				<description>
					Flushes the stream and checks its error state. The internal error state is set to true when the underlying output stream throws an IOException other than InterruptedIOException, and when the setError method is invoked. If an operation on the underlying output stream throws an InterruptedIOException, then the PrintStream converts the exception back into an interrupt by doing:        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();   or the equivalent.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void clearError()
				</name>
				<description>
					Clears the internal error state of this stream. This method will cause subsequent invocations of checkError() to return false until another write operation fails and invokes setError().
				</description>
