		<description>
			A Dialog is a top-level window with a title and a border that is typically used to take some form of input from the user. The size of the dialog includes any area designated for the border. The dimensions of the border area can be obtained using the getInsets method, however, since these dimensions are platform-dependent, a valid insets value cannot be obtained until the dialog is made displayable by either calling pack or show. Since the border area is included in the overall size of the dialog, the border effectively obscures a portion of the dialog, constraining the area available for rendering and/or displaying subcomponents to the rectangle which has an upper-left corner location of (insets.left, insets.top), and has a size of width - (insets.left + insets.right) by height - (insets.top + insets.bottom). The default layout for a dialog is BorderLayout. A dialog may have its native decorations (i.e. Frame & Titlebar) turned off with setUndecorated. This can only be done while the dialog is not displayable. A dialog may have another window as its owner when it's constructed. When the owner window of a visible dialog is minimized, the dialog will automatically be hidden from the user. When the owner window is subsequently restored, the dialog is made visible to the user again. In a multi-screen environment, you can create a Dialog on a different screen device than its owner. See Frame for more information. A dialog can be either modeless (the default) or modal. A modal dialog is one which blocks input to some other top-level windows in the application, except for any windows created with the dialog as their owner. See AWT Modality specification for details. Dialogs are capable of generating the following WindowEvents: WindowOpened, WindowClosing, WindowClosed, WindowActivated, WindowDeactivated, WindowGainedFocus, WindowLostFocus.

					@Deprecated  public void show()
				</name>
				<description>
					Deprecated. As of JDK version 1.5, replaced by setVisible(boolean). Makes the Dialog visible. If the dialog and/or its owner are not yet displayable, both are made displayable. The dialog will be validated prior to being made visible. If the dialog is already visible, this will bring the dialog to the front. If the dialog is modal and is not already visible, this call will not return until the dialog is hidden by calling hide or dispose. It is permissible to show modal dialogs from the event dispatching thread because the toolkit will ensure that another event pump runs while the one which invoked this method is blocked.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void toBack()
				</name>
				<description>
					If this Window is visible, sends this Window to the back and may cause it to lose focus or activation if it is the focused or active Window. Places this Window at the bottom of the stacking order and shows it behind any other Windows in this VM. No action will take place is this Window is not visible. Some platforms do not allow Windows which are owned by other Windows to appear below their owners. Every attempt will be made to move this Window as low as possible in the stacking order; however, developers should not assume that this method will move this Window below all other windows in every situation. Because of variations in native windowing systems, no guarantees about changes to the focused and active Windows can be made. Developers must never assume that this Window is no longer the focused or active Window until this Window receives a WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS or WINDOW_DEACTIVATED event. On platforms where the top-most window is the focused window, this method will probably cause this Window to lose focus. In that case, the next highest, focusable Window in this VM will receive focus. On platforms where the stacking order does not typically affect the focused window, this method will probably leave the focused and active Windows unchanged. If this dialog is modal and blocks some windows, then all of them are also sent to the back to keep them below the blocking dialog.

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isResizable()
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates whether this dialog is resizable by the user. By default, all dialogs are initially resizable.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setUndecorated(boolean undecorated)
				</name>
				<description>
					Disables or enables decorations for this dialog. This method can only be called while the dialog is not displayable. To make this dialog decorated, it must be opaque and have the default shape, otherwise the IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. Refer to Window.setShape(java.awt.Shape), Window.setOpacity(float) and Window.setBackground(java.awt.Color) for details
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean isUndecorated()
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates whether this dialog is undecorated. By default, all dialogs are initially decorated.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setOpacity(float opacity)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the opacity of the window. The opacity value is in the range [0..1]. Note that setting the opacity level of 0 may or may not disable the mouse event handling on this window. This is a platform-dependent behavior. The following conditions must be met in order to set the opacity value less than 1.0f: The TRANSLUCENT translucency must be supported by the underlying system The window must be undecorated (see Frame.setUndecorated(boolean) and setUndecorated(boolean)) The window must not be in full-screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window)) If the requested opacity value is less than 1.0f, and any of the above conditions are not met, the window opacity will not change, and the IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. The translucency levels of individual pixels may also be effected by the alpha component of their color (see Window.setBackground(Color)) and the current shape of this window (see Window.setShape(Shape)).
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setShape(Shape shape)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the shape of the window. Setting a shape cuts off some parts of the window. Only the parts that belong to the given Shape remain visible and clickable. If the shape argument is null, this method restores the default shape, making the window rectangular on most platforms. The following conditions must be met to set a non-null shape: The PERPIXEL_TRANSPARENT translucency must be supported by the underlying system The window must be undecorated (see Frame.setUndecorated(boolean) and setUndecorated(boolean)) The window must not be in full-screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window)) If the requested shape is not null, and any of the above conditions are not met, the shape of this window will not change, and either the UnsupportedOperationException or IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. The tranlucency levels of individual pixels may also be effected by the alpha component of their color (see Window.setBackground(Color)) and the opacity value (see Window.setOpacity(float)). See GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency for more details.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setBackground(Color bgColor)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the background color of this window. If the windowing system supports the PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT tranclucency, the alpha component of the given background color may effect the mode of operation for this window: it indicates whether this window must be opaque (alpha equals 1.0f) or per-pixel translucent (alpha is less than 1.0f). If the given background color is null, the window is considered completely opaque. All the following conditions must be met to enable the per-pixel transparency mode for this window: The PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT translucency must be supported by the graphics device where this window is located The window must be undecorated (see Frame.setUndecorated(boolean) and setUndecorated(boolean)) The window must not be in full-screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window)) If the alpha component of the requested background color is less than 1.0f, and any of the above conditions are not met, the background color of this window will not change, the alpha component of the given background color will not affect the mode of operation for this window, and either the UnsupportedOperationException or IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown. When the window is per-pixel translucent, the drawing sub-system respects the alpha value of each individual pixel. If a pixel gets painted with the alpha color component equal to zero, it becomes visually transparent. If the alpha of the pixel is equal to 1.0f, the pixel is fully opaque. Interim values of the alpha color component make the pixel semi-transparent. In this mode, the background of the window gets painted with the alpha value of the given background color. If the alpha value of the argument of this method is equal to 0, the background is not painted at all. The actual level of translucency of a given pixel also depends on window opacity (see Window.setOpacity(float)), as well as the current shape of this window (see Window.setShape(Shape)). Note that painting a pixel with the alpha value of 0 may or may not disable the mouse event handling on this pixel. This is a platform-dependent behavior. To make sure the mouse events do not get dispatched to a particular pixel, the pixel must be excluded from the shape of the window. Enabling the per-pixel translucency mode may change the graphics configuration of this window due to the native platform requirements.
