			public interface Connection  extends Wrapper, AutoCloseable
		</name>
		<description>
			A connection (session) with a specific database. SQL statements are executed and results are returned within the context of a connection. A Connection object's database is able to provide information describing its tables, its supported SQL grammar, its stored procedures, the capabilities of this connection, and so on. This information is obtained with the getMetaData method. Note: When configuring a Connection, JDBC applications should use the appropriate Connection method such as setAutoCommit or setTransactionIsolation. Applications should not invoke SQL commands directly to change the connection's configuration when there is a JDBC method available. By default a Connection object is in auto-commit mode, which means that it automatically commits changes after executing each statement. If auto-commit mode has been disabled, the method commit must be called explicitly in order to commit changes; otherwise, database changes will not be saved. A new Connection object created using the JDBC 2.1 core API has an initially empty type map associated with it. A user may enter a custom mapping for a UDT in this type map. When a UDT is retrieved from a data source with the method ResultSet.getObject, the getObject method will check the connection's type map to see if there is an entry for that UDT. If so, the getObject method will map the UDT to the class indicated. If there is no entry, the UDT will be mapped using the standard mapping. A user may create a new type map, which is a java.util.Map object, make an entry in it, and pass it to the java.sql methods that can perform custom mapping. In this case, the method will use the given type map instead of the one associated with the connection. For example, the following code fragment specifies that the SQL type ATHLETES will be mapped to the class Athletes in the Java programming language. The code fragment retrieves the type map for the Connection object con, inserts the entry into it, and then sets the type map with the new entry as the connection's type map.         java.util.Map map = con.getTypeMap();        map.put("mySchemaName.ATHLETES", Class.forName("Athletes"));        con.setTypeMap(map);

		<methods>
			<method>
				<name>
					static final int TRANSACTION_NONE
				</name>
				<description>
					A constant indicating that transactions are not supported.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					static final int TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED
				</name>
				<description>
					A constant indicating that dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur. This level allows a row changed by one transaction to be read by another transaction before any changes in that row have been committed (a "dirty read"). If any of the changes are rolled back, the second transaction will have retrieved an invalid row.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					static final int TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED
				</name>
				<description>
					A constant indicating that dirty reads are prevented; non-repeatable reads and phantom reads can occur. This level only prohibits a transaction from reading a row with uncommitted changes in it.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					static final int TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ
				</name>
				<description>
					A constant indicating that dirty reads and non-repeatable reads are prevented; phantom reads can occur. This level prohibits a transaction from reading a row with uncommitted changes in it, and it also prohibits the situation where one transaction reads a row, a second transaction alters the row, and the first transaction rereads the row, getting different values the second time (a "non-repeatable read").
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					static final int TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE
				</name>
				<description>
					A constant indicating that dirty reads, non-repeatable reads and phantom reads are prevented. This level includes the prohibitions in TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ and further prohibits the situation where one transaction reads all rows that satisfy a WHERE condition, a second transaction inserts a row that satisfies that WHERE condition, and the first transaction rereads for the same condition, retrieving the additional "phantom" row in the second read.

					Statement createStatement()                            throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a Statement object for sending SQL statements to the database. SQL statements without parameters are normally executed using Statement objects. If the same SQL statement is executed many times, it may be more efficient to use a PreparedStatement object. Result sets created using the returned Statement object will by default be type TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY and have a concurrency level of CONCUR_READ_ONLY. The holdability of the created result sets can be determined by calling getHoldability().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					PreparedStatement prepareStatement(String sql)                                     throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a PreparedStatement object for sending parameterized SQL statements to the database. A SQL statement with or without IN parameters can be pre-compiled and stored in a PreparedStatement object. This object can then be used to efficiently execute this statement multiple times. Note: This method is optimized for handling parametric SQL statements that benefit from precompilation. If the driver supports precompilation, the method prepareStatement will send the statement to the database for precompilation. Some drivers may not support precompilation. In this case, the statement may not be sent to the database until the PreparedStatement object is executed. This has no direct effect on users; however, it does affect which methods throw certain SQLException objects. Result sets created using the returned PreparedStatement object will by default be type TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY and have a concurrency level of CONCUR_READ_ONLY. The holdability of the created result sets can be determined by calling getHoldability().
				</description>

				<name>
					CallableStatement prepareCall(String sql)                                throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a CallableStatement object for calling database stored procedures. The CallableStatement object provides methods for setting up its IN and OUT parameters, and methods for executing the call to a stored procedure. Note: This method is optimized for handling stored procedure call statements. Some drivers may send the call statement to the database when the method prepareCall is done; others may wait until the CallableStatement object is executed. This has no direct effect on users; however, it does affect which method throws certain SQLExceptions. Result sets created using the returned CallableStatement object will by default be type TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY and have a concurrency level of CONCUR_READ_ONLY. The holdability of the created result sets can be determined by calling getHoldability().
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					String nativeSQL(String sql)                   throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Converts the given SQL statement into the system's native SQL grammar. A driver may convert the JDBC SQL grammar into its system's native SQL grammar prior to sending it. This method returns the native form of the statement that the driver would have sent.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void setAutoCommit(boolean autoCommit)                     throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets this connection's auto-commit mode to the given state. If a connection is in auto-commit mode, then all its SQL statements will be executed and committed as individual transactions. Otherwise, its SQL statements are grouped into transactions that are terminated by a call to either the method commit or the method rollback. By default, new connections are in auto-commit mode. The commit occurs when the statement completes. The time when the statement completes depends on the type of SQL Statement: For DML statements, such as Insert, Update or Delete, and DDL statements, the statement is complete as soon as it has finished executing. For Select statements, the statement is complete when the associated result set is closed. For CallableStatement objects or for statements that return multiple results, the statement is complete when all of the associated result sets have been closed, and all update counts and output parameters have been retrieved. NOTE: If this method is called during a transaction and the auto-commit mode is changed, the transaction is committed. If setAutoCommit is called and the auto-commit mode is not changed, the call is a no-op.

				<name>
					boolean getAutoCommit()                        throws SQLException

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void commit()              throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Makes all changes made since the previous commit/rollback permanent and releases any database locks currently held by this Connection object. This method should be used only when auto-commit mode has been disabled.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void rollback()                throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Undoes all changes made in the current transaction and releases any database locks currently held by this Connection object. This method should be used only when auto-commit mode has been disabled.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void close()             throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Releases this Connection object's database and JDBC resources immediately instead of waiting for them to be automatically released. Calling the method close on a Connection object that is already closed is a no-op. It is strongly recommended that an application explicitly commits or rolls back an active transaction prior to calling the close method. If the close method is called and there is an active transaction, the results are implementation-defined.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean isClosed()                   throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves whether this Connection object has been closed. A connection is closed if the method close has been called on it or if certain fatal errors have occurred. This method is guaranteed to return true only when it is called after the method Connection.close has been called. This method generally cannot be called to determine whether a connection to a database is valid or invalid. A typical client can determine that a connection is invalid by catching any exceptions that might be thrown when an operation is attempted.

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void setCatalog(String catalog)                  throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the given catalog name in order to select a subspace of this Connection object's database in which to work. If the driver does not support catalogs, it will silently ignore this request. Calling setCatalog has no effect on previously created or prepared Statement objects. It is implementation defined whether a DBMS prepare operation takes place immediately when the Connection method prepareStatement or prepareCall is invoked. For maximum portability, setCatalog should be called before a Statement is created or prepared.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					String getCatalog()                    throws SQLException

				</name>
				<description>
					Attempts to change the transaction isolation level for this Connection object to the one given. The constants defined in the interface Connection are the possible transaction isolation levels. Note: If this method is called during a transaction, the result is implementation-defined.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					int getTransactionIsolation()                              throws SQLException

			<method>
				<name>
					SQLWarning getWarnings()                         throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the first warning reported by calls on this Connection object. If there is more than one warning, subsequent warnings will be chained to the first one and can be retrieved by calling the method SQLWarning.getNextWarning on the warning that was retrieved previously. This method may not be called on a closed connection; doing so will cause an SQLException to be thrown. Note: Subsequent warnings will be chained to this SQLWarning.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					void clearWarnings()                     throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>

				</name>
				<description>
					Retrieves the Map object associated with this Connection object. Unless the application has added an entry, the type map returned will be empty. You must invoke setTypeMap after making changes to the Map object returned from getTypeMap as a JDBC driver may create an internal copy of the Map object passed to setTypeMap:         Map<String,Class<?>> myMap = con.getTypeMap();        myMap.put("mySchemaName.ATHLETES", Athletes.class);        con.setTypeMap(myMap);

				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a default PreparedStatement object that has the capability to retrieve auto-generated keys. The given constant tells the driver whether it should make auto-generated keys available for retrieval. This parameter is ignored if the SQL statement is not an INSERT statement, or an SQL statement able to return auto-generated keys (the list of such statements is vendor-specific). Note: This method is optimized for handling parametric SQL statements that benefit from precompilation. If the driver supports precompilation, the method prepareStatement will send the statement to the database for precompilation. Some drivers may not support precompilation. In this case, the statement may not be sent to the database until the PreparedStatement object is executed. This has no direct effect on users; however, it does affect which methods throw certain SQLExceptions. Result sets created using the returned PreparedStatement object will by default be type TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY and have a concurrency level of CONCUR_READ_ONLY. The holdability of the created result sets can be determined by calling getHoldability().

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the value of the client info property specified by name to the value specified by value. Applications may use the DatabaseMetaData.getClientInfoProperties method to determine the client info properties supported by the driver and the maximum length that may be specified for each property. The driver stores the value specified in a suitable location in the database. For example in a special register, session parameter, or system table column. For efficiency the driver may defer setting the value in the database until the next time a statement is executed or prepared. Other than storing the client information in the appropriate place in the database, these methods shall not alter the behavior of the connection in anyway. The values supplied to these methods are used for accounting, diagnostics and debugging purposes only. The driver shall generate a warning if the client info name specified is not recognized by the driver. If the value specified to this method is greater than the maximum length for the property the driver may either truncate the value and generate a warning or generate a SQLClientInfoException. If the driver generates a SQLClientInfoException, the value specified was not set on the connection. The following are standard client info properties. Drivers are not required to support these properties however if the driver supports a client info property that can be described by one of the standard properties, the standard property name should be used. ApplicationName - The name of the application currently utilizing the connection ClientUser - The name of the user that the application using the connection is performing work for. This may not be the same as the user name that was used in establishing the connection. ClientHostname - The hostname of the computer the application using the connection is running on.

					void setClientInfo(Properties properties)                     throws SQLClientInfoException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the value of the connection's client info properties. The Properties object contains the names and values of the client info properties to be set. The set of client info properties contained in the properties list replaces the current set of client info properties on the connection. If a property that is currently set on the connection is not present in the properties list, that property is cleared. Specifying an empty properties list will clear all of the properties on the connection. See setClientInfo (String, String) for more information. If an error occurs in setting any of the client info properties, a SQLClientInfoException is thrown. The SQLClientInfoException contains information indicating which client info properties were not set. The state of the client information is unknown because some databases do not allow multiple client info properties to be set atomically. For those databases, one or more properties may have been set before the error occurred.

				<description>
					Returns the value of the client info property specified by name. This method may return null if the specified client info property has not been set and does not have a default value. This method will also return null if the specified client info property name is not supported by the driver. Applications may use the DatabaseMetaData.getClientInfoProperties method to determine the client info properties supported by the driver.

					Array createArrayOf(String typeName,                    Object[] elements)                      throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Factory method for creating Array objects. Note: When createArrayOf is used to create an array object that maps to a primitive data type, then it is implementation-defined whether the Array object is an array of that primitive data type or an array of Object. Note: The JDBC driver is responsible for mapping the elements Object array to the default JDBC SQL type defined in java.sql.Types for the given class of Object. The default mapping is specified in Appendix B of the JDBC specification. If the resulting JDBC type is not the appropriate type for the given typeName then it is implementation defined whether an SQLException is thrown or the driver supports the resulting conversion.

				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the given schema name to access. If the driver does not support schemas, it will silently ignore this request. Calling setSchema has no effect on previously created or prepared Statement objects. It is implementation defined whether a DBMS prepare operation takes place immediately when the Connection method prepareStatement or prepareCall is invoked. For maximum portability, setSchema should be called before a Statement is created or prepared.

					void abort(Executor executor)             throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Terminates an open connection. Calling abort results in: The connection marked as closed Closes any physical connection to the database Releases resources used by the connection Insures that any thread that is currently accessing the connection will either progress to completion or throw an SQLException. Calling abort marks the connection closed and releases any resources. Calling abort on a closed connection is a no-op. It is possible that the aborting and releasing of the resources that are held by the connection can take an extended period of time. When the abort method returns, the connection will have been marked as closed and the Executor that was passed as a parameter to abort may still be executing tasks to release resources. This method checks to see that there is an SQLPermission object before allowing the method to proceed. If a SecurityManager exists and its checkPermission method denies calling abort, this method throws a java.lang.SecurityException.

					void setNetworkTimeout(Executor executor,                       int milliseconds)                         throws SQLException
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the maximum period a Connection or objects created from the Connection will wait for the database to reply to any one request. If any request remains unanswered, the waiting method will return with a SQLException, and the Connection or objects created from the Connection will be marked as closed. Any subsequent use of the objects, with the exception of the close, isClosed or Connection.isValid methods, will result in a SQLException. Note: This method is intended to address a rare but serious condition where network partitions can cause threads issuing JDBC calls to hang uninterruptedly in socket reads, until the OS TCP-TIMEOUT (typically 10 minutes). This method is related to the abort() method which provides an administrator thread a means to free any such threads in cases where the JDBC connection is accessible to the administrator thread. The setNetworkTimeout method will cover cases where there is no administrator thread, or it has no access to the connection. This method is severe in it's effects, and should be given a high enough value so it is never triggered before any more normal timeouts, such as transaction timeouts. JDBC driver implementations may also choose to support the setNetworkTimeout method to impose a limit on database response time, in environments where no network is present. Drivers may internally implement some or all of their API calls with multiple internal driver-database transmissions, and it is left to the driver implementation to determine whether the limit will be applied always to the response to the API call, or to any single request made during the API call. This method can be invoked more than once, such as to set a limit for an area of JDBC code, and to reset to the default on exit from this area. Invocation of this method has no impact on already outstanding requests. The Statement.setQueryTimeout() timeout value is independent of the timeout value specified in setNetworkTimeout. If the query timeout expires before the network timeout then the statement execution will be canceled. If the network is still active the result will be that both the statement and connection are still usable. However if the network timeout expires before the query timeout or if the statement timeout fails due to network problems, the connection will be marked as closed, any resources held by the connection will be released and both the connection and statement will be unusable. When the driver determines that the setNetworkTimeout timeout value has expired, the JDBC driver marks the connection closed and releases any resources held by the connection. This method checks to see that there is an SQLPermission object before allowing the method to proceed. If a SecurityManager exists and its checkPermission method denies calling setNetworkTimeout, this method throws a java.lang.SecurityException.
