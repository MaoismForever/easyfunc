			public abstract class SocketFactory  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			This class creates sockets. It may be subclassed by other factories, which create particular subclasses of sockets and thus provide a general framework for the addition of public socket-level functionality. Socket factories are a simple way to capture a variety of policies related to the sockets being constructed, producing such sockets in a way which does not require special configuration of the code which asks for the sockets: Due to polymorphism of both factories and sockets, different kinds of sockets can be used by the same application code just by passing it different kinds of factories. Factories can themselves be customized with parameters used in socket construction. So for example, factories could be customized to return sockets with different networking timeouts or security parameters already configured. The sockets returned to the application can be subclasses of java.net.Socket, so that they can directly expose new APIs for features such as compression, security, record marking, statistics collection, or firewall tunneling. Factory classes are specified by environment-specific configuration mechanisms. For example, the getDefault method could return a factory that was appropriate for a particular user or applet, and a framework could use a factory customized to its own purposes.

				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a socket and connects it to the specified remote host at the specified remote port. This socket is configured using the socket options established for this factory. If there is a security manager, its checkConnect method is called with the host address and port as its arguments. This could result in a SecurityException.

				</name>
				<description>
					Creates a socket and connects it to the specified remote host on the specified remote port. The socket will also be bound to the local address and port supplied. This socket is configured using the socket options established for this factory. If there is a security manager, its checkConnect method is called with the host address and port as its arguments. This could result in a SecurityException.

				<description>
					Creates a socket and connects it to the specified port number at the specified address. This socket is configured using the socket options established for this factory. If there is a security manager, its checkConnect method is called with the host address and port as its arguments. This could result in a SecurityException.

					Creates a socket and connect it to the specified remote address on the specified remote port. The socket will also be bound to the local address and port suplied. The socket is configured using the socket options established for this factory. If there is a security manager, its checkConnect method is called with the host address and port as its arguments. This could result in a SecurityException.
