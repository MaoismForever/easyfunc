			@Deprecated  public class DefaultLoaderRepository  extends Object
		</name>
		<description>
			Deprecated.  Use MBeanServer.getClassLoaderRepository()} instead. Keeps the list of Class Loaders registered in the MBean Server. It provides the necessary methods to load classes using the registered Class Loaders. This deprecated class is maintained for compatibility. In previous versions of JMX, there was one DefaultLoaderRepository shared by all MBean servers. As of JMX 1.2, that functionality is approximated by using MBeanServerFactory.findMBeanServer(java.lang.String) to find all known MBean servers, and consulting the ClassLoaderRepository of each one. It is strongly recommended that code referencing DefaultLoaderRepository be rewritten.
