			public class ConfigurationException  extends NamingException
		</name>
		<description>
			This exception is thrown when there is a configuration problem. This can arise when installation of a provider was not done correctly, or if there are configuration problems with the server, or if configuration information required to access the provider or service is malformed or missing. For example, a request to use SSL as the security protocol when the service provider software was not configured with the SSL component would cause such an exception. Another example is if the provider requires that a URL be specified as one of the environment properties but the client failed to provide it. Synchronization and serialization issues that apply to NamingException apply directly here.
