			JTextField is a lightweight component that allows the editing of a single line of text. For information on and examples of using text fields, see How to Use Text Fields in The Java Tutorial. JTextField is intended to be source-compatible with java.awt.TextField where it is reasonable to do so. This component has capabilities not found in the java.awt.TextField class. The superclass should be consulted for additional capabilities. JTextField has a method to establish the string used as the command string for the action event that gets fired. The java.awt.TextField used the text of the field as the command string for the ActionEvent. JTextField will use the command string set with the setActionCommand method if not null, otherwise it will use the text of the field as a compatibility with java.awt.TextField. The method setEchoChar and getEchoChar are not provided directly to avoid a new implementation of a pluggable look-and-feel inadvertently exposing password characters. To provide password-like services a separate class JPasswordField extends JTextField to provide this service with an independently pluggable look-and-feel. The java.awt.TextField could be monitored for changes by adding a TextListener for TextEvent's. In the JTextComponent based components, changes are broadcasted from the model via a DocumentEvent to DocumentListeners. The DocumentEvent gives the location of the change and the kind of change if desired. The code fragment might look something like:        DocumentListener myListener = ??;       JTextField myArea = ??;       myArea.getDocument().addDocumentListener(myListener);   The horizontal alignment of JTextField can be set to be left justified, leading justified, centered, right justified or trailing justified. Right/trailing justification is useful if the required size of the field text is smaller than the size allocated to it. This is determined by the setHorizontalAlignment and getHorizontalAlignment methods. The default is to be leading justified. How the text field consumes VK_ENTER events depends on whether the text field has any action listeners. If so, then VK_ENTER results in the listeners getting an ActionEvent, and the VK_ENTER event is consumed. This is compatible with how AWT text fields handle VK_ENTER events. If the text field has no action listeners, then as of v 1.3 the VK_ENTER event is not consumed. Instead, the bindings of ancestor components are processed, which enables the default button feature of JFC/Swing to work. Customized fields can easily be created by extending the model and changing the default model provided. For example, the following piece of code will create a field that holds only upper case characters. It will work even if text is pasted into from the clipboard or it is altered via programmatic changes.      public class UpperCaseField extends JTextField {          public UpperCaseField(int cols) {           super(cols);       }          protected Document createDefaultModel() {           return new UpperCaseDocument();       }          static class UpperCaseDocument extends PlainDocument {              public void insertString(int offs, String str, AttributeSet a)               throws BadLocationException {                  if (str == null) {                   return;               }               char[] upper = str.toCharArray();               for (int i = 0; i < upper.length; i++) {                   upper[i] = Character.toUpperCase(upper[i]);               }               super.insertString(offs, new String(upper), a);           }       }   }     Warning: Swing is not thread safe. For more information see Swing's Threading Policy. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.

			<method>
				<name>
					public void setActionCommand(String command)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the command string used for action events.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setAction(Action a)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the Action for the ActionEvent source. The new Action replaces any previously set Action but does not affect ActionListeners independently added with addActionListener. If the Action is already a registered ActionListener for the ActionEvent source, it is not re-registered. Setting the Action results in immediately changing all the properties described in Swing Components Supporting Action. Subsequently, the textfield's properties are automatically updated as the Action's properties change. This method uses three other methods to set and help track the Action's property values. It uses the configurePropertiesFromAction method to immediately change the textfield's properties. To track changes in the Action's property values, this method registers the PropertyChangeListener returned by createActionPropertyChangeListener. The default PropertyChangeListener invokes the actionPropertyChanged method when a property in the Action changes.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Action getAction()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the currently set Action for this ActionEvent source, or null if no Action is set.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void configurePropertiesFromAction(Action a)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the properties on this textfield to match those in the specified Action. Refer to Swing Components Supporting Action for more details as to which properties this sets.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected void actionPropertyChanged(Action action,                           String propertyName)
				</name>
				<description>
					Updates the textfield's state in response to property changes in associated action. This method is invoked from the PropertyChangeListener returned from createActionPropertyChangeListener. Subclasses do not normally need to invoke this. Subclasses that support additional Action properties should override this and configurePropertiesFromAction. Refer to the table at Swing Components Supporting Action for a list of the properties this method sets.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected PropertyChangeListener createActionPropertyChangeListener(Action a)
				</name>
				<description>
					Creates and returns a PropertyChangeListener that is responsible for listening for changes from the specified Action and updating the appropriate properties. Warning: If you subclass this do not create an anonymous inner class. If you do the lifetime of the textfield will be tied to that of the Action.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public Action[] getActions()
				</name>
				<description>
					Fetches the command list for the editor. This is the list of commands supported by the plugged-in UI augmented by the collection of commands that the editor itself supports. These are useful for binding to events, such as in a keymap.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void postActionEvent()
				</name>
				<description>
					Processes action events occurring on this textfield by dispatching them to any registered ActionListener objects. This is normally called by the controller registered with textfield.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public BoundedRangeModel getHorizontalVisibility()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the visibility of the text field. This can be adjusted to change the location of the visible area if the size of the field is greater than the area that was allocated to the field. The fields look-and-feel implementation manages the values of the minimum, maximum, and extent properties on the BoundedRangeModel.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getScrollOffset()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the scroll offset, in pixels.

			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setScrollOffset(int scrollOffset)
				</name>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					protected String paramString()
				</name>
				<description>

				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public AccessibleContext getAccessibleContext()
				</name>
				<description>
