		<description>
			The Scrollbar class embodies a scroll bar, a familiar user-interface object. A scroll bar provides a convenient means for allowing a user to select from a range of values. The following three vertical scroll bars could be used as slider controls to pick the red, green, and blue components of a color: Each scroll bar in this example could be created with code similar to the following:    redSlider=new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.VERTICAL, 0, 1, 0, 255);   add(redSlider);   Alternatively, a scroll bar can represent a range of values. For example, if a scroll bar is used for scrolling through text, the width of the "bubble" (also called the "thumb" or "scroll box") can be used to represent the amount of text that is visible. Here is an example of a scroll bar that represents a range: The value range represented by the bubble in this example is the visible amount. The horizontal scroll bar in this example could be created with code like the following:    ranger = new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.HORIZONTAL, 0, 60, 0, 300);   add(ranger);   Note that the actual maximum value of the scroll bar is the maximum minus the visible amount. In the previous example, because the maximum is 300 and the visible amount is 60, the actual maximum value is 240. The range of the scrollbar track is 0 - 300. The left side of the bubble indicates the value of the scroll bar. Normally, the user changes the value of the scroll bar by making a gesture with the mouse. For example, the user can drag the scroll bar's bubble up and down, or click in the scroll bar's unit increment or block increment areas. Keyboard gestures can also be mapped to the scroll bar. By convention, the Page Up and Page Down keys are equivalent to clicking in the scroll bar's block increment and block decrement areas. When the user changes the value of the scroll bar, the scroll bar receives an instance of AdjustmentEvent. The scroll bar processes this event, passing it along to any registered listeners. Any object that wishes to be notified of changes to the scroll bar's value should implement AdjustmentListener, an interface defined in the package java.awt.event. Listeners can be added and removed dynamically by calling the methods addAdjustmentListener and removeAdjustmentListener. The AdjustmentEvent class defines five types of adjustment event, listed here: AdjustmentEvent.TRACK is sent out when the user drags the scroll bar's bubble. AdjustmentEvent.UNIT_INCREMENT is sent out when the user clicks in the left arrow of a horizontal scroll bar, or the top arrow of a vertical scroll bar, or makes the equivalent gesture from the keyboard. AdjustmentEvent.UNIT_DECREMENT is sent out when the user clicks in the right arrow of a horizontal scroll bar, or the bottom arrow of a vertical scroll bar, or makes the equivalent gesture from the keyboard. AdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_INCREMENT is sent out when the user clicks in the track, to the left of the bubble on a horizontal scroll bar, or above the bubble on a vertical scroll bar. By convention, the Page Up key is equivalent, if the user is using a keyboard that defines a Page Up key. AdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_DECREMENT is sent out when the user clicks in the track, to the right of the bubble on a horizontal scroll bar, or below the bubble on a vertical scroll bar. By convention, the Page Down key is equivalent, if the user is using a keyboard that defines a Page Down key. The JDK 1.0 event system is supported for backwards compatibility, but its use with newer versions of the platform is discouraged. The five types of adjustment events introduced with JDK 1.1 correspond to the five event types that are associated with scroll bars in previous platform versions. The following list gives the adjustment event type, and the corresponding JDK 1.0 event type it replaces. AdjustmentEvent.TRACK replaces Event.SCROLL_ABSOLUTE AdjustmentEvent.UNIT_INCREMENT replaces Event.SCROLL_LINE_UP AdjustmentEvent.UNIT_DECREMENT replaces Event.SCROLL_LINE_DOWN AdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_INCREMENT replaces Event.SCROLL_PAGE_UP AdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_DECREMENT replaces Event.SCROLL_PAGE_DOWN Note: We recommend using a Scrollbar for value selection only. If you want to implement a scrollable component inside a container, we recommend you use a ScrollPane. If you use a Scrollbar for this purpose, you are likely to encounter issues with painting, key handling, sizing and positioning.

					public void setValue(int newValue)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the value of this scroll bar to the specified value. If the value supplied is less than the current minimum or greater than the current maximum - visibleAmount, then either minimum or maximum - visibleAmount is substituted, as appropriate. Normally, a program should change a scroll bar's value only by calling setValues. The setValues method simultaneously and synchronously sets the minimum, maximum, visible amount, and value properties of a scroll bar, so that they are mutually consistent. Calling this method does not fire an AdjustmentEvent.

				<description>
					Gets the minimum value of this scroll bar.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setMinimum(int newMinimum)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the minimum value of this scroll bar. When setMinimum is called, the minimum value is changed, and other values (including the maximum, the visible amount, and the current scroll bar value) are changed to be consistent with the new minimum. Normally, a program should change a scroll bar's minimum value only by calling setValues. The setValues method simultaneously and synchronously sets the minimum, maximum, visible amount, and value properties of a scroll bar, so that they are mutually consistent. Note that setting the minimum value to Integer.MAX_VALUE will result in the new minimum value being set to Integer.MAX_VALUE - 1.

					public int getMaximum()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the maximum value of this scroll bar.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public void setMaximum(int newMaximum)
				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the maximum value of this scroll bar. When setMaximum is called, the maximum value is changed, and other values (including the minimum, the visible amount, and the current scroll bar value) are changed to be consistent with the new maximum. Normally, a program should change a scroll bar's maximum value only by calling setValues. The setValues method simultaneously and synchronously sets the minimum, maximum, visible amount, and value properties of a scroll bar, so that they are mutually consistent. Note that setting the maximum value to Integer.MIN_VALUE will result in the new maximum value being set to Integer.MIN_VALUE + 1.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public int getVisibleAmount()
				</name>
				<description>
					Gets the visible amount of this scroll bar. When a scroll bar is used to select a range of values, the visible amount is used to represent the range of values that are currently visible. The size of the scroll bar's bubble (also called a thumb or scroll box), usually gives a visual representation of the relationship of the visible amount to the range of the scroll bar. Note that depending on platform, the value of the visible amount property may not be visually indicated by the size of the bubble. The scroll bar's bubble may not be displayed when it is not moveable (e.g. when it takes up the entire length of the scroll bar's track, or when the scroll bar is disabled). Whether the bubble is displayed or not will not affect the value returned by getVisibleAmount.

The scroll bar's bubble may not be displayed when it is not moveable (e.g. when it takes up the entire length of the scroll bar's track, or when the scroll bar is disabled). Whether the bubble is displayed or not will not affect the value returned by getVisibleAmount. If the visible amount supplied is less than one or greater than the current maximum - minimum, then either one or maximum - minimum is substituted, as appropriate. Normally, a program should change a scroll bar's value only by calling setValues.
