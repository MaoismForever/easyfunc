		<description>
			An action to set the font family in the associated JEditorPane. This will use the family specified as the command string on the ActionEvent if there is one, otherwise the family that was initialized with will be used. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
