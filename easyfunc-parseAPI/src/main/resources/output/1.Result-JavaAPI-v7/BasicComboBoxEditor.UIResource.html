		</name>
		<description>
			A subclass of BasicComboBoxEditor that implements UIResource. BasicComboBoxEditor doesn't implement UIResource directly so that applications can safely override the cellRenderer property with BasicListCellRenderer subclasses. Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see XMLEncoder.
