		<description>
			The DirectColorModel class is a ColorModel class that works with pixel values that represent RGB color and alpha information as separate samples and that pack all samples for a single pixel into a single int, short, or byte quantity. This class can be used only with ColorSpaces of type ColorSpace.TYPE_RGB. In addition, for each component of the ColorSpace, the minimum normalized component value obtained via the getMinValue() method of ColorSpace must be 0.0, and the maximum value obtained via the getMaxValue() method must be 1.0 (these min/max values are typical for RGB spaces). There must be three color samples in the pixel values and there can be a single alpha sample. For those methods that use a primitive array pixel representation of type transferType, the array length is always one. The transfer types supported are DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, and DataBuffer.TYPE_INT. Color and alpha samples are stored in the single element of the array in bits indicated by bit masks. Each bit mask must be contiguous and masks must not overlap. The same masks apply to the single int pixel representation used by other methods. The correspondence of masks and color/alpha samples is as follows: Masks are identified by indices running from 0 through 2 if no alpha is present, or 3 if an alpha is present. The first three indices refer to color samples; index 0 corresponds to red, index 1 to green, and index 2 to blue. Index 3 corresponds to the alpha sample, if present. The translation from pixel values to color/alpha components for display or processing purposes is a one-to-one correspondence of samples to components. A DirectColorModel is typically used with image data which uses masks to define packed samples. For example, a DirectColorModel can be used in conjunction with a SinglePixelPackedSampleModel to construct a BufferedImage. Normally the masks used by the SampleModel and the ColorModel would be the same. However, if they are different, the color interpretation of pixel data will be done according to the masks of the ColorModel. A single int pixel representation is valid for all objects of this class, since it is always possible to represent pixel values used with this class in a single int. Therefore, methods which use this representation will not throw an IllegalArgumentException due to an invalid pixel value. This color model is similar to an X11 TrueColor visual. The default RGB ColorModel specified by the getRGBdefault method is a DirectColorModel with the following parameters:    Number of bits:        32   Red mask:              0x00ff0000   Green mask:            0x0000ff00   Blue mask:             0x000000ff   Alpha mask:            0xff000000   Color space:           sRGB   isAlphaPremultiplied:  False   Transparency:          Transparency.TRANSLUCENT   transferType:          DataBuffer.TYPE_INT   Many of the methods in this class are final. This is because the underlying native graphics code makes assumptions about the layout and operation of this class and those assumptions are reflected in the implementations of the methods here that are marked final. You can subclass this class for other reasons, but you cannot override or modify the behavior of those methods.

					public DirectColorModel(int bits,                  int rmask,                  int gmask,                  int bmask)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a DirectColorModel from the specified masks that indicate which bits in an int pixel representation contain the red, green and blue color samples. As pixel values do not contain alpha information, all pixels are treated as opaque, which means that alpha = 1.0. All of the bits in each mask must be contiguous and fit in the specified number of least significant bits of an int pixel representation. The ColorSpace is the default sRGB space. The transparency value is Transparency.OPAQUE. The transfer type is the smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel.

				<description>
					Constructs a DirectColorModel from the specified masks that indicate which bits in an int pixel representation contain the red, green and blue color samples and the alpha sample, if present. If amask is 0, pixel values do not contain alpha information and all pixels are treated as opaque, which means that alpha = 1.0. All of the bits in each mask must be contiguous and fit in the specified number of least significant bits of an int pixel representation. Alpha, if present, is not premultiplied. The ColorSpace is the default sRGB space. The transparency value is Transparency.OPAQUE if no alpha is present, or Transparency.TRANSLUCENT otherwise. The transfer type is the smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT that can hold a single pixel.

				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs a DirectColorModel from the specified parameters. Color components are in the specified ColorSpace, which must be of type ColorSpace.TYPE_RGB and have minimum normalized component values which are all 0.0 and maximum values which are all 1.0. The masks specify which bits in an int pixel representation contain the red, green and blue color samples and the alpha sample, if present. If amask is 0, pixel values do not contain alpha information and all pixels are treated as opaque, which means that alpha = 1.0. All of the bits in each mask must be contiguous and fit in the specified number of least significant bits of an int pixel representation. If there is alpha, the boolean isAlphaPremultiplied specifies how to interpret color and alpha samples in pixel values. If the boolean is true, color samples are assumed to have been multiplied by the alpha sample. The transparency value is Transparency.OPAQUE, if no alpha is present, or Transparency.TRANSLUCENT otherwise. The transfer type is the type of primitive array used to represent pixel values and must be one of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, or DataBuffer.TYPE_INT.

					Returns the color/alpha components of the pixel in the default RGB color model format. A color conversion is done if necessary. The pixel value is specified as an int.

				<description>
					Returns the red color component for the specified pixel, scaled from 0 to 255 in the default RGB ColorSpace, sRGB. A color conversion is done if necessary. The pixel value is specified by an array of data elements of type transferType passed in as an object reference. The returned value is a non pre-multiplied value. Thus, if the alpha is premultiplied, this method divides it out before returning the value. If the alpha value is 0, for example, the red value is 0. If inData is not a primitive array of type transferType, a ClassCastException is thrown. An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown if inData is not large enough to hold a pixel value for this ColorModel. Since DirectColorModel can be subclassed, subclasses inherit the implementation of this method and if they don't override it then they throw an exception if they use an unsupported transferType. An UnsupportedOperationException is thrown if this transferType is not supported by this ColorModel.
