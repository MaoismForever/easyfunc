					Handles update of the Relation Service role map for the update of given role in given relation. It is called in relation MBean setRole() (for given role) and setRoles() (for each role) methods (implementation provided in RelationSupport class). It is also called in Relation Service setRole() (for given role) and setRoles() (for each role) methods. To allow the Relation Service to maintain the consistency (in case of MBean unregistration) and to be able to perform queries, this method must be called when a role is updated.

					void purgeRelations()                      throws RelationServiceNotRegisteredException
				</name>
				<description>
					Purges the relations. Depending on the purgeFlag value, this method is either called automatically when a notification is received for the unregistration of an MBean referenced in a relation (if the flag is set to true), or not (if the flag is set to false). In that case it is up to the user to call it to maintain the consistency of the relations. To be kept in mind that if an MBean is unregistered and the purge not done immediately, if the ObjectName is reused and assigned to another MBean referenced in a relation, calling manually this purgeRelations() method will cause trouble, as will consider the ObjectName as corresponding to the unregistered MBean, not seeing the new one. The behavior depends on the cardinality of the role where the unregistered MBean is referenced: - if removing one MBean reference in the role makes its number of references less than the minimum degree, the relation has to be removed. - if the remaining number of references after removing the MBean reference is still in the cardinality range, keep the relation and update it calling its handleMBeanUnregistration() callback.
