		<description>
			A Line.Info object contains information about a line. The only information provided by Line.Info itself is the Java class of the line. A subclass of Line.Info adds other kinds of information about the line. This additional information depends on which Line subinterface is implemented by the kind of line that the Line.Info subclass describes. A Line.Info can be retrieved using various methods of the Line, Mixer, and AudioSystem interfaces. Other such methods let you pass a Line.Info as an argument, to learn whether lines matching the specified configuration are available and to obtain them.

			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean matches(Line.Info info)
				</name>
				<description>
					Indicates whether the specified info object matches this one. To match, the specified object must be identical to or a special case of this one. The specified info object must be either an instance of the same class as this one, or an instance of a sub-type of this one. In addition, the attributes of the specified object must be compatible with the capabilities of this one. Specifically, the routing configuration for the specified info object must be compatible with that of this one. Subclasses may add other criteria to determine whether the two objects match.
