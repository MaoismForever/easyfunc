			<method>
				<name>
					String getValue()
				</name>

					Returns the value of this node if this is a Text node or the value of the immediate child of this node otherwise. If there is an immediate child of this Node that it is a Text node then it's value will be returned. If there is more than one Text node then the value of the first Text Node will be returned. Otherwise null is returned.
