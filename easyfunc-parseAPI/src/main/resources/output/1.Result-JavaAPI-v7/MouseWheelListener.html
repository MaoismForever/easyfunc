		<description>
			The listener interface for receiving mouse wheel events on a component. (For clicks and other mouse events, use the MouseListener. For mouse movement and drags, use the MouseMotionListener.) The class that is interested in processing a mouse wheel event implements this interface (and all the methods it contains). The listener object created from that class is then registered with a component using the component's addMouseWheelListener method. A mouse wheel event is generated when the mouse wheel is rotated. When a mouse wheel event occurs, that object's mouseWheelMoved method is invoked. For information on how mouse wheel events are dispatched, see the class description for MouseWheelEvent.
