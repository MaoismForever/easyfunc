		<description>
			Class JobKOctetsSupported is a printing attribute class, a set of integers, that gives the supported values for a JobKOctets attribute. It is restricted to a single contiguous range of integers; multiple non-overlapping ranges are not allowed. This gives the lower and upper bounds of the total sizes of print jobs in units of K octets (1024 octets) that the printer will accept. IPP Compatibility: The JobKOctetsSupported attribute's canonical array form gives the lower and upper bound for the range of values to be included in an IPP "job-k-octets-supported" attribute. See class SetOfIntegerSyntax for an explanation of canonical array form. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.

			<method>
				<name>
					public JobKOctetsSupported(int lowerBound,                     int upperBound)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a new job K octets supported attribute containing a single range of integers. That is, only those values of JobKOctets in the one range are supported.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean equals(Object object)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether this job K octets supported attribute is equivalent to the passed in object. To be equivalent, all of the following conditions must be true: object is not null. object is an instance of class JobKOctetsSupported. This job K octets supported attribute's members and object's members are the same.

			<method>
				<name>
					public final Class<? extends Attribute> getCategory()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the printing attribute class which is to be used as the "category" for this printing attribute value. For class JobKOctetsSupported, the category is class JobKOctetsSupported itself.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final String getName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the name of the category of which this attribute value is an instance. For class JobKOctetsSupported, the category name is "job-k-octets-supported".
