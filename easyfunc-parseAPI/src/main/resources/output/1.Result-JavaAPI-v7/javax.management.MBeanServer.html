		</name>
		<description>
			This is the interface for MBean manipulation on the agent side. It contains the methods necessary for the creation, registration, and deletion of MBeans as well as the access methods for registered MBeans. This is the core component of the JMX infrastructure. User code does not usually implement this interface. Instead, an object that implements this interface is obtained with one of the methods in the MBeanServerFactory class. Every MBean which is added to the MBean server becomes manageable: its attributes and operations become remotely accessible through the connectors/adaptors connected to that MBean server. A Java object cannot be registered in the MBean server unless it is a JMX compliant MBean. When an MBean is registered or unregistered in the MBean server a MBeanServerNotification Notification is emitted. To register an object as listener to MBeanServerNotifications you should call the MBean server method addNotificationListener with ObjectName the ObjectName of the MBeanServerDelegate. This ObjectName is: JMImplementation:type=MBeanServerDelegate. An object obtained from the createMBeanServer or newMBeanServer methods of the MBeanServerFactory class applies security checks to its methods, as follows. First, if there is no security manager (System.getSecurityManager() is null), then an implementation of this interface is free not to make any checks. Assuming that there is a security manager, or that the implementation chooses to make checks anyway, the checks are made as detailed below. In what follows, and unless otherwise specified, className is the string returned by MBeanInfo.getClassName() for the target MBean. If a security check fails, the method throws SecurityException. For methods that can throw InstanceNotFoundException, this exception is thrown for a non-existent MBean, regardless of permissions. This is because a non-existent MBean has no className. For the invoke method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, operationName, name, "invoke"). For the getAttribute method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, attribute, name, "getAttribute"). For the getAttributes method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "getAttribute"). Additionally, for each attribute a in the AttributeList, if the caller's permissions do not imply MBeanPermission(className, a, name, "getAttribute"), the MBean server will behave as if that attribute had not been in the supplied list. For the setAttribute method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, attrName, name, "setAttribute"), where attrName is attribute.getName(). For the setAttributes method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "setAttribute"). Additionally, for each attribute a in the AttributeList, if the caller's permissions do not imply MBeanPermission(className, a, name, "setAttribute"), the MBean server will behave as if that attribute had not been in the supplied list. For the addNotificationListener methods, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "addNotificationListener"). For the removeNotificationListener methods, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "removeNotificationListener"). For the getMBeanInfo method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "getMBeanInfo"). For the getObjectInstance method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "getObjectInstance"). For the isInstanceOf method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "isInstanceOf"). For the queryMBeans method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(null, null, null, "queryMBeans"). Additionally, for each MBean n that matches name, if the caller's permissions do not imply MBeanPermission(className, null, n, "queryMBeans"), the MBean server will behave as if that MBean did not exist. Certain query elements perform operations on the MBean server. If the caller does not have the required permissions for a given MBean, that MBean will not be included in the result of the query. The standard query elements that are affected are Query.attr(String), Query.attr(String,String), and Query.classattr(). For the queryNames method, the checks are the same as for queryMBeans except that "queryNames" is used instead of "queryMBeans" in the MBeanPermission objects. Note that a "queryMBeans" permission implies the corresponding "queryNames" permission. For the getDomains method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(null, null, null, "getDomains"). Additionally, for each domain d in the returned array, if the caller's permissions do not imply MBeanPermission(null, null, new ObjectName("d:x=x"), "getDomains"), the domain is eliminated from the array. Here, x=x is any key=value pair, needed to satisfy ObjectName's constructor but not otherwise relevant. For the getClassLoader method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, loaderName, "getClassLoader"). For the getClassLoaderFor method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, mbeanName, "getClassLoaderFor"). For the getClassLoaderRepository method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(null, null, null, "getClassLoaderRepository"). For the deprecated deserialize methods, the required permissions are the same as for the methods that replace them. For the instantiate methods, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, null, "instantiate"), where className is the name of the class which is to be instantiated. For the registerMBean method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "registerMBean"). If the MBeanPermission check succeeds, the MBean's class is validated by checking that its ProtectionDomain implies MBeanTrustPermission("register"). Finally, if the name argument is null, another MBeanPermission check is made using the ObjectName returned by MBeanRegistration.preRegister. For the createMBean methods, the caller's permissions must imply the permissions needed by the equivalent instantiate followed by registerMBean. For the unregisterMBean method, the caller's permissions must imply MBeanPermission(className, null, name, "unregisterMBean").

					Description copied from interface: MBeanServerConnection Sets the values of several attributes of a named MBean. The MBean is identified by its object name. If one or more attributes cannot be set for some reason, they will be omitted from the returned AttributeList. The caller should check that the input AttributeList is the same size as the output one. To discover what problem prevented a given attribute from being retrieved, it will usually be possible to call setAttribute for that attribute, although this is not guaranteed to work. (For example, the values of two attributes may have been rejected because they were inconsistent with each other. Setting one of them alone might be allowed.) Here is an example of calling this method and checking that it succeeded in setting all the requested attributes:    AttributeList inputAttrs = ...;   AttributeList outputAttrs = mbeanServerConnection.setAttributes(objectName, inputAttrs);   if (inputAttrs.size() == outputAttrs.size())       System.out.println("All attributes were set successfully");   else {       List<String> missing = new ArrayList<String>();       for (Attribute a : inputAttrs.asList())           missing.add(a.getName());       for (Attribute a : outputAttrs.asList())           missing.remove(a.getName());       System.out.println("Did not set: " + missing);   }

				<description>
					Description copied from interface: MBeanServerConnection Invokes an operation on an MBean. Because of the need for a signature to differentiate possibly-overloaded operations, it is much simpler to invoke operations through an MBean proxy where possible. For example, suppose you have a Standard MBean interface like this:    public interface FooMBean {       public int countMatches(String[] patterns, boolean ignoreCase);   }   The countMatches operation can be invoked as follows:    String[] myPatterns = ...;   int count = (Integer) mbeanServerConnection.invoke(           objectName,           "countMatches",           new Object[] {myPatterns, true},           new String[] {String[].class.getName(), boolean.class.getName()});   Alternatively, it can be invoked through a proxy as follows:    String[] myPatterns = ...;   FooMBean fooProxy = JMX.newMBeanProxy(           mbeanServerConnection, objectName, FooMBean.class);   int count = fooProxy.countMatches(myPatterns, true);

					Description copied from interface: MBeanServerConnection Returns true if the MBean specified is an instance of the specified class, false otherwise. If name does not name an MBean, this method throws InstanceNotFoundException. Otherwise, let X be the MBean named by name, L be the ClassLoader of X, N be the class name in X's MBeanInfo. If N equals className, the result is true. Otherwise, if L successfully loads className and X is an instance of this class, the result is true. Otherwise, if L successfully loads both N and className, and the second class is assignable from the first, the result is true. Otherwise, the result is false.
