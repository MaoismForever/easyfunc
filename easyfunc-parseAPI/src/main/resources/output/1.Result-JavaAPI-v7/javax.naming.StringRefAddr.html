		<description>
			This class represents the string form of the address of a communications end-point. It consists of a type that describes the communication mechanism and a string contents specific to that communication mechanism. The format and interpretation of the address type and the contents of the address are based on the agreement of three parties: the client that uses the address, the object/server that can be reached using the address, and the administrator or program that creates the address. An example of a string reference address is a host name. Another example of a string reference address is a URL. A string reference address is immutable: once created, it cannot be changed. Multithreaded access to a single StringRefAddr need not be synchronized.
