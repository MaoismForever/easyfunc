		<description>
			The IndexColorModel class is a ColorModel class that works with pixel values consisting of a single sample that is an index into a fixed colormap in the default sRGB color space. The colormap specifies red, green, blue, and optional alpha components corresponding to each index. All components are represented in the colormap as 8-bit unsigned integral values. Some constructors allow the caller to specify "holes" in the colormap by indicating which colormap entries are valid and which represent unusable colors via the bits set in a BigInteger object. This color model is similar to an X11 PseudoColor visual. Some constructors provide a means to specify an alpha component for each pixel in the colormap, while others either provide no such means or, in some cases, a flag to indicate whether the colormap data contains alpha values. If no alpha is supplied to the constructor, an opaque alpha component (alpha = 1.0) is assumed for each entry. An optional transparent pixel value can be supplied that indicates a pixel to be made completely transparent, regardless of any alpha component supplied or assumed for that pixel value. Note that the color components in the colormap of an IndexColorModel objects are never pre-multiplied with the alpha components. The transparency of an IndexColorModel object is determined by examining the alpha components of the colors in the colormap and choosing the most specific value after considering the optional alpha values and any transparent index specified. The transparency value is Transparency.OPAQUE only if all valid colors in the colormap are opaque and there is no valid transparent pixel. If all valid colors in the colormap are either completely opaque (alpha = 1.0) or completely transparent (alpha = 0.0), which typically occurs when a valid transparent pixel is specified, the value is Transparency.BITMASK. Otherwise, the value is Transparency.TRANSLUCENT, indicating that some valid color has an alpha component that is neither completely transparent nor completely opaque (0.0 < alpha < 1.0). If an IndexColorModel object has a transparency value of Transparency.OPAQUE, then the hasAlpha and getNumComponents methods (both inherited from ColorModel) return false and 3, respectively. For any other transparency value, hasAlpha returns true and getNumComponents returns 4. The values used to index into the colormap are taken from the least significant n bits of pixel representations where n is based on the pixel size specified in the constructor. For pixel sizes smaller than 8 bits, n is rounded up to a power of two (3 becomes 4 and 5,6,7 become 8). For pixel sizes between 8 and 16 bits, n is equal to the pixel size. Pixel sizes larger than 16 bits are not supported by this class. Higher order bits beyond n are ignored in pixel representations. Index values greater than or equal to the map size, but less than 2n, are undefined and return 0 for all color and alpha components. For those methods that use a primitive array pixel representation of type transferType, the array length is always one. The transfer types supported are DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE and DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT. A single int pixel representation is valid for all objects of this class, since it is always possible to represent pixel values used with this class in a single int. Therefore, methods that use this representation do not throw an IllegalArgumentException due to an invalid pixel value. Many of the methods in this class are final. The reason for this is that the underlying native graphics code makes assumptions about the layout and operation of this class and those assumptions are reflected in the implementations of the methods here that are marked final. You can subclass this class for other reasons, but you cannot override or modify the behaviour of those methods.

					public IndexColorModel(int bits,                 int size,                 byte[] r,                 byte[] g,                 byte[] b)
				</name>
				<description>
					Constructs an IndexColorModel from the specified arrays of red, green, and blue components. Pixels described by this color model all have alpha components of 255 unnormalized (1.0 normalized), which means they are fully opaque. All of the arrays specifying the color components must have at least the specified number of entries. The ColorSpace is the default sRGB space. Since there is no alpha information in any of the arguments to this constructor, the transparency value is always Transparency.OPAQUE. The transfer type is the smallest of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE or DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT that can hold a single pixel.
