		<description>
			The DragGestureRecognizer is an abstract base class for the specification of a platform-dependent listener that can be associated with a particular Component in order to identify platform-dependent drag initiating gestures. The appropriate DragGestureRecognizer subclass instance is obtained from the DragSource asssociated with a particular Component, or from the Toolkit object via its createDragGestureRecognizer() method. Once the DragGestureRecognizer is associated with a particular Component it will register the appropriate listener interfaces on that Component in order to track the input events delivered to the Component. Once the DragGestureRecognizer identifies a sequence of events on the Component as a drag initiating gesture, it will notify its unicast DragGestureListener by invoking its gestureRecognized() method. When a concrete DragGestureRecognizer instance detects a drag initiating gesture on the Component it is associated with, it fires a DragGestureEvent to the DragGestureListener registered on its unicast event source for DragGestureListener events. This DragGestureListener is responsible for causing the associated DragSource to start the Drag and Drop operation (if appropriate).
