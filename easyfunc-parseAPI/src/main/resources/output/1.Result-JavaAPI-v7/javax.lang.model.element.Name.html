			public interface Name  extends CharSequence
		</name>
		<description>
			An immutable sequence of characters. When created by the same implementation, objects implementing this interface must obey the general equals contract when compared with each other. Therefore, Name objects from the same implementation are usable in collections while Names from different implementations may not work properly in collections. An empty Name has a length of zero. In the context of annotation processing, the guarantees for "the same" implementation must include contexts where the API mediated side effects of processors could be visible to each other, including successive annotation processing rounds.

			<method>
				<name>
					boolean equals(Object obj)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns true if the argument represents the same name as this, and false otherwise. Note that the identity of a Name is a function both of its content in terms of a sequence of characters as well as the implementation which created it.

			<method>
				<name>
					int hashCode()
				</name>
				<description>
					Obeys the general contract of Object.hashCode.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					boolean contentEquals(CharSequence cs)
				</name>
				<description>
					Compares this name to the specified CharSequence. The result is true if and only if this name represents the same sequence of char values as the specified sequence.
