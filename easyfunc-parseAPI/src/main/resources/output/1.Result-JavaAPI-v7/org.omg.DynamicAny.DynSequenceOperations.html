				</name>
				<description>
					Sets the length of the sequence. Increasing the length of a sequence adds new elements at the tail without affecting the values of already existing elements. Newly added elements are default-initialized. Increasing the length of a sequence sets the current position to the first newly-added element if the previous current position was -1. Otherwise, if the previous current position was not -1, the current position is not affected. Decreasing the length of a sequence removes elements from the tail without affecting the value of those elements that remain. The new current position after decreasing the length of a sequence is determined as follows: If the length of the sequence is set to zero, the current position is set to -1. If the current position is -1 before decreasing the length, it remains at -1. If the current position indicates a valid element and that element is not removed when the length is decreased, the current position remains unaffected. If the current position indicates a valid element and that element is removed, the current position is set to -1.

				<description>
					Sets the elements of a sequence. The length of the DynSequence is set to the length of value. The current position is set to zero if value has non-zero length and to -1 if value is a zero-length sequence.

				<description>
					Sets the elements of a sequence using DynAnys. The length of the DynSequence is set to the length of value. The current position is set to zero if value has non-zero length and to -1 if value is a zero-length sequence.
