			public abstract class EditorKit  extends Object  implements Cloneable, Serializable
		</name>
		<description>
			Establishes the set of things needed by a text component to be a reasonably functioning editor for some type of text content. The EditorKit acts as a factory for some kind of policy. For example, an implementation of html and rtf can be provided that is replaceable with other implementations. A kit can safely store editing state as an instance of the kit will be dedicated to a text component. New kits will normally be created by cloning a prototype kit. The kit will have it's setComponent method called to establish it's relationship with a JTextComponent.

					public abstract void read(InputStream in,          Document doc,          int pos)                     throws IOException,                            BadLocationException
				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts content from the given stream which is expected to be in a format appropriate for this kind of content handler.

				<name>
					public abstract void write(OutputStream out,           Document doc,           int pos,           int len)                      throws IOException,                             BadLocationException

					public abstract void read(Reader in,          Document doc,          int pos)                     throws IOException,                            BadLocationException
				</name>
				<description>
					Inserts content from the given stream which is expected to be in a format appropriate for this kind of content handler. Since actual text editing is unicode based, this would generally be the preferred way to read in the data. Some types of content are stored in an 8-bit form however, and will favor the InputStream.
