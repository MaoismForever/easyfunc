		<description>
			Associates the MIME type that controls the XML representation of the property. This annotation is used in conjunction with datatypes such as Image or Source that are bound to base64-encoded binary in XML. If a property that has this annotation has a sibling property bound to the xmime:contentType attribute, and if in the instance the property has a value, the value of the attribute takes precedence and that will control the marshalling.
