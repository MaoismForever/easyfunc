			Class PageRanges is a printing attribute class, a set of integers, that identifies the range(s) of print-stream pages that the Printer object uses for each copy of each document which are to be printed. Nothing is printed for any pages identified that do not exist in the document(s). The attribute is associated with print-stream pages, not application-numbered pages (for example, the page numbers found in the headers and or footers for certain word processing applications). In most cases, the exact pages to be printed will be generated by a device driver and this attribute would not be required. However, when printing an archived document which has already been formatted, the end user may elect to print just a subset of the pages contained in the document. In this case, if a page range of "n-m" is specified, the first page to be printed will be page n. All subsequent pages of the document will be printed through and including page m. If a PageRanges attribute is not specified for a print job, all pages of the document will be printed. In other words, the default value for the PageRanges attribute is always {{1, Integer.MAX_VALUE}}. The effect of a PageRanges attribute on a multidoc print job (a job with multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same page ranges specified or whether different docs have different page ranges specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the MultipleDocumentHandling attribute. If all the docs have the same page ranges specified, then any value of MultipleDocumentHandling makes sense, and the printer's processing depends on the MultipleDocumentHandling value: SINGLE_DOCUMENT -- All the input docs will be combined together into one output document. The specified page ranges of that output document will be printed. SINGLE_DOCUMENT_NEW_SHEET -- All the input docs will be combined together into one output document, and the first impression of each input doc will always start on a new media sheet. The specified page ranges of that output document will be printed. SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES -- For each separate input doc, the specified page ranges will be printed. SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES -- For each separate input doc, the specified page ranges will be printed. SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_UNCOLLATED_COPIES -- For each separate input doc, its own specified page ranges will be printed.. SEPARATE_DOCUMENTS_COLLATED_COPIES -- For each separate input doc, its own specified page ranges will be printed.. IPP Compatibility: The PageRanges attribute's canonical array form gives the lower and upper bound for each range of pages to be included in and IPP "page-ranges" attribute. See class SetOfIntegerSyntax for an explanation of canonical array form. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.

					Construct a new page ranges attribute with the given members in string form. See class SetOfIntegerSyntax for explanation of the syntax.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public PageRanges(int member)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a new page ranges attribute containing a single integer. That is, only the one page is to be printed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public PageRanges(int lowerBound,            int upperBound)
				</name>
				<description>
					Construct a new page ranges attribute containing a single range of integers. That is, only those pages in the one range are to be printed.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public boolean equals(Object object)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns whether this page ranges attribute is equivalent to the passed in object. To be equivalent, all of the following conditions must be true: object is not null. object is an instance of class PageRanges. This page ranges attribute's members and object's members are the same.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final Class<? extends Attribute> getCategory()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the printing attribute class which is to be used as the "category" for this printing attribute value. For class PageRanges, the category is class PageRanges itself.
				</description>
				
			</method>
			<method>
				<name>
					public final String getName()
				</name>
				<description>
					Get the name of the category of which this attribute value is an instance. For class PageRanges, the category name is "page-ranges".
