		<description>
			Annotation used to identify other annotations as a WebServiceFeature. Each WebServiceFeature annotation annotated with this annotation MUST contain an enabled property of type boolean with a default value of true. JAX-WS defines the following WebServiceFeature annotations (Addressing, MTOM, RespectBinding), however, an implementation may define vendors specific annotations for other features. Annotations annotated with WebServiceFeatureAnnotation MUST have the same @Target of WebServiceRef annotation, so that the resulting feature annotation can be used in conjunction with the WebServiceRef annotation if necessary. If a JAX-WS implementation encounters an annotation annotated with the WebServiceFeatureAnnotation that it does not recognize/support an error MUST be given.
