		<description>
			The formats of IOR components and service context data used by ORB services are often defined as CDR encapsulations encoding instances of IDL defined data types. The Codec provides a mechanism to transfer these components between their IDL data types and their CDR encapsulation representations. A Codec is obtained from the CodecFactory. The CodecFactory is obtained through a call to ORB.resolve_initial_references( "CodecFactory" ).
