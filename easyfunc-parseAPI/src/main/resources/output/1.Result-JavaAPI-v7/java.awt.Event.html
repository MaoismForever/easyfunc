			NOTE: The Event class is obsolete and is available only for backwards compatilibility. It has been replaced by the AWTEvent class and its subclasses. Event is a platform-independent class that encapsulates events from the platform's Graphical User Interface in the Java 1.0 event model. In Java 1.1 and later versions, the Event class is maintained only for backwards compatibilty. The information in this class description is provided to assist programmers in converting Java 1.0 programs to the new event model. In the Java 1.0 event model, an event contains an id field that indicates what type of event it is and which other Event variables are relevant for the event. For keyboard events, key contains a value indicating which key was activated, and modifiers contains the modifiers for that event. For the KEY_PRESS and KEY_RELEASE event ids, the value of key is the unicode character code for the key. For KEY_ACTION and KEY_ACTION_RELEASE, the value of key is one of the defined action-key identifiers in the Event class (PGUP, PGDN, F1, F2, etc).
