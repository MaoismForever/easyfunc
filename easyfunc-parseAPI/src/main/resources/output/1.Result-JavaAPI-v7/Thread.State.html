		<description>
			A thread state. A thread can be in one of the following states: NEW A thread that has not yet started is in this state. RUNNABLE A thread executing in the Java virtual machine is in this state. BLOCKED A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock is in this state. WAITING A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action is in this state. TIMED_WAITING A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time is in this state. TERMINATED A thread that has exited is in this state. A thread can be in only one state at a given point in time. These states are virtual machine states which do not reflect any operating system thread states.

				<description>
					Thread state for a thread which has not yet started.

					public static final Thread.State RUNNABLE
				</name>
				<description>
					Thread state for a runnable thread. A thread in the runnable state is executing in the Java virtual machine but it may be waiting for other resources from the operating system such as processor.

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final Thread.State BLOCKED
				</name>
				<description>
					Thread state for a thread blocked waiting for a monitor lock. A thread in the blocked state is waiting for a monitor lock to enter a synchronized block/method or reenter a synchronized block/method after calling Object.wait.
				</description>

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final Thread.State WAITING
				</name>
				<description>
					Thread state for a waiting thread. A thread is in the waiting state due to calling one of the following methods: Object.wait with no timeout Thread.join with no timeout LockSupport.park A thread in the waiting state is waiting for another thread to perform a particular action. For example, a thread that has called Object.wait() on an object is waiting for another thread to call Object.notify() or Object.notifyAll() on that object. A thread that has called Thread.join() is waiting for a specified thread to terminate.

				<description>
					Thread state for a waiting thread with a specified waiting time. A thread is in the timed waiting state due to calling one of the following methods with a specified positive waiting time: Thread.sleep Object.wait with timeout Thread.join with timeout LockSupport.parkNanos LockSupport.parkUntil

			<method>
				<name>
					public static final Thread.State TERMINATED

			<method>
				<name>
					public static Thread.State[] values()
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns an array containing the constants of this enum type, in the order they are declared. This method may be used to iterate over the constants as follows:   for (Thread.State c : Thread.State.values())      System.out.println(c);

			<method>
				<name>
					public static Thread.State valueOf(String name)
				</name>
				<description>
					Returns the enum constant of this type with the specified name. The string must match exactly an identifier used to declare an enum constant in this type. (Extraneous whitespace characters are not permitted.)
