			public interface PrivilegedExceptionAction<T>

		<description>
			A computation to be performed with privileges enabled, that throws one or more checked exceptions. The computation is performed by invoking AccessController.doPrivileged on the PrivilegedExceptionAction object. This interface is used only for computations that throw checked exceptions; computations that do not throw checked exceptions should use PrivilegedAction instead.
