		<description>
			A pair of channels that implements a unidirectional pipe. A pipe consists of a pair of channels: A writable sink channel and a readable source channel. Once some bytes are written to the sink channel they can be read from source channel in exactly the order in which they were written. Whether or not a thread writing bytes to a pipe will block until another thread reads those bytes, or some previously-written bytes, from the pipe is system-dependent and therefore unspecified. Many pipe implementations will buffer up to a certain number of bytes between the sink and source channels, but such buffering should not be assumed.
