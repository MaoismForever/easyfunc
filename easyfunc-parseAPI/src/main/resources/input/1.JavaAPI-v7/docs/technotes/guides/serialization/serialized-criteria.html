<h1>Criteria for Including Classes in the Serialized Form Specification</h1>

<p>The purpose of the Serialized Form specification is to ensure that a 
serialized object can successfully be passed between different 
implementations of the Java Platform.</p> 

<p>This is Oracle's criteria for determining if a class should be included
in the serialized form specification:</p>

<ul> 
 <LI><B>Public and protected classes</B> <BR/>
     If a class is public or protected and implements <code>Serializable</code>
     (directly or indirectly through <code>implements</code> or
     <code>extends</code>) then its serial form must be included 
     in the spec.  An example is the public class
     <CODE>java.applet.Applet</CODE> (which indirectly extends
     <CODE>Component</CODE> which implements <CODE>Serializable</CODE>).</LI>
   
 <LI><B>Private and package-private classes</B> <BR/>
     If a private or package-private class implements <code>Serializable</code>, 
     <I>and</I> a user of a public class can, via a factory method, 
     access that object, <I>and</I> if the spec (doc comment) explicitly 
     guarantees that the object is serializable, then the serial form 
     must be included.  An example is the private class
     <CODE>java.util.Arrays.ArrayList</CODE>.</LI>
     
</UL>

     <p>In both cases, rare exceptions can be made where the class
     in question was never intended to be serialized across
     implementations or releases.  (The excluded Swing classes fall 
     into this category.  Swing uses a different mechanism to
     provide the needed functionality.)</p>
<p>

To satisfy this criteria, the design engineer of each class needs to 
verify whether that class is actually part of the published serialized 
form of a public or protected API class, rather than just a class used 
in the implementation that also happens to be serializable.</p>
<p>

Note - Interfaces do not have serialized forms, and so would not appear
in the Serialized Form specification.</p>

<h3>Doc Comment @serial Tag</h3>

<p>By default, version 1.3 of Javadoc includes public and protected classes 
that implement Serializable, and excludes private and package-private classes 
that implement Serializable.
Version 1.3 of Javadoc has no mechanism for excluding the former from or 
including the latter in the Serialized Form spec, as may be needed
in satisfying the above criteria.</p>

<p>
We have instituted a mechanism in Javadoc 1.4 for marking 
serializable classes for inclusion or exclusion in the spec.
(We used it for generating the 1.3 serialized form spec, but 
the mechanism was implemented too late to be included in 
Javadoc 1.3.)  It does the following:</p>

<UL>

   <LI>Includes public and protected classes that implement 
       <code>Serializable</code>, unless they or their packages are 
       marked with <code>@serial&nbsp;exclude</code></LI>

   <LI>Excludes private and package-private classes that implement 
       <code>Serializable</code>, unless they or their packages are marked 
       with <code>@serial&nbsp;include</code></LI>
</UL>

<p>The Javdaoc 1.4 reference page also describes this.</p>
